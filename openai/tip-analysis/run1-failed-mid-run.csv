5575,2324,1,"It's on old building from 1890, so there's only so much that can be done about sound from other rooms. At times, i could hear the neighbors having a conversation, and of course, if there's someone walking and talking in the hallways, you can hear that as well. So if you're one of those that has to have complete silence, this may not be the place for you. It's also located right in the heart of the Gaslamp district, so on Friday and Saturday night, it can be relatively loud as you can hear street-level noise. Again, it's not too bad, but if you like complete silence, this is not for you.

Also, there's not much of a lobby area to hang out, which is somewhat unfortunate. So if you're looking to have people meet you in the lobby or just hang out with friends/family there, there's no where to do that. Not a huge deal, but if you're expecting there to be a spacious lobby, there is only 1 small couch/bench to sit on, and that's it.",Helpful.

8765,3666,1,"Any tourist's most important decision in Rome should be to hire our phenomenal guide, Fabio Luciano.  In my 40 years of extensive traveling throughout the world, he is the best of the best.  Fabio is a passionate PhD archeologist in his mid-30's who knows everyone and everything.  He brought Rome alive by telling us the context and back stories associated with what we were seeing.  As he participated in the excavation of the Forum, Coliseum and other buildings as part of his studies, he was able to tell us the secrets of the buildings, such as the remarkable technology the Romans (and their slaves) used behind the scenes to make the Coliseum such gruesome but effective theater for the masses. 

Fabio also has extensive contacts at the Vatican.  We were able to stay late and see the Sistine Chapel by ourselves--remarkable.  As important, he pointed out details that we would have certainly missed by ourselves, such as the two panels of God--his front as well as his backside--in the center of Michelangelo's remarkable creation.

In two and a half days, we saw in depth more than we would have ""seen"" in a week of wandering--by ourselves, or with typical guides--and really learned about Rome.  Fabio is the guide of choice of celebrities that range from international royalty to Rudy Giuliani, Hugh Hefner and Bruce Springstein.  Fabio is loved by all, is fun and charismatic, and is a superb teacher who brings Rome alive.  Although he would be worth it at any price, Fabio is remarkably affordable.

First off, it was described as having a living area and a kitchen, which it did not have. it was only a kitchen, bedroom & a hallway (and bath with no tub).  The single sleeper sofa in the kitchen was turned into a bed for our 5 year old son, and the other single bed for my 5 year old daughter was put in the hallway which was not a very nice spot for a bed for many reasons, not the least of which is that there was not a proper blind.  So we rearranged the furniture and moved the bed next to the sofa (i.e.both children slept in the kitchen).  Other things I would have expected in a 4 star would be shampoo, lotion, tissues, etc.  The apt only had shampoo and soap.  Small stuff, I know, but things you'd expect in a 4 star.  Also, they advertise  breakfast vouchers for a cafe across the road as if you're getting some great deal (free reservation?).  Hardly a deal as the food was below par and service was poor, too.

Rooms were small - with the dark walls, dark lighting, dark everything, it left me feeling sad and dreary vs. rested.  We also unfortunately were placed on a floor with others who were apparently friends and spent the night in and out of each others rooms slamming doors. When we complained, we were moved to another floor - but the doorjam had apparently been bent from a previous burglary attempt.   Felt like a hotel better suited for spring break than a relaxing stay in Manhatten. Location is great but unless you are ready for a dim experience, go elsewhere. ",Negative.

Never got it, nor the complimentary WiFi or room upgrade announced by Tablet Hotels. Got the free cocktail promissed after talking to 4 people (2 at the bar and 2 at the front desk at checkout) ; none have ever heard about Tablet and its ""complimentary services"". 

Another poor point of my stay was the awful view from my room (1907) which overlooked the Langham shopping mall (in contrast with the statement ""From Level 11 to 22 and offering great views of the fascinating city"").

Was so looking forward to my week there with my 2 best girlfriends as it looked like a great location to party with friends in Honolulu & a cool atmosphere. I booked on tablethotels.com.

We had to check out early due to the awful service, some of which included: 

* when i arrived I had to put a ""hold"" on my credit card (which is totally normal at all of the hotels I stay in) I thought the $1000 was a bit excessive (seeing as the room doesn't even have a mini bar) but agreed. What they didn't tell me was that in the proceeding days they tried to take more money from my credit card for the remainder of the weeks stay (total of about $2500) without telling me.

* when they couldn't ""hold"" the rest of the money on my credit card (I live in Indonesia & my bank had put a hold on my card due to these unauthorised transactions) we were locked out of our room

* we of course went to find the manager & were told there was no manager available to see us but they would be in contact

* in the next 2 days nobody contacted us. We went back to reception to find another manager to again be told that there was no manager on site to speak with. We were told that someone had tried to call us in our room but (surprise surprise) we were not in the room (we were on the beach DOH!)

* the next morning a security guy came to our door to ""check we were still in the hotel""

* that night we had booked dinner at Morimoto in the hotel (the restaurant was fantastic) for a birthday dinner. When the meal was finished they would not let us sign the meal to our room.

* so we found when we went up to our room that we had been locked out AGAIN!

* so AGAIN we went to reception to find a manager to speak with & no one was available (it was about 11pm at night)

* the gentleman (not) at the reception desk said they would not let us back into our room until we had paid the whole bill. We questioned why we needed to",helpful

The gardens are beautiful and the cove is gorgeous. However, you do not see in any photo or video, the large, loud, crowded beach with loud music next door. I asked for ear plugs, which they had on hand. Obviously. The entire time, I felt like nobody was at work in the place. The wait staff at the hotel was basically invisible. I was the hotel's only guest and waited for long periods at a time to be served. At one point, I was in the dining area for 30 minutes, sitting at a table and had to shout over the loud music for anyone to hear me.
