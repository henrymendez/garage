"5","2","1","Hotel bien placé mais bruyant.
les chambres sont tristes mais spacieuses.
la vue est moche, l'hôtel a une vu sur un immeuble de bureau. pas agréable du tout."
"10","4","1","Try to get rooms that face the street, there is more natural light than the rooms facing the atrium. Walking the neighborhood and making your way through the Jardin de Luxembourg and making your way to the river is a wonderful walk."
"13","5","1","Great location for mid-town shopping and the MoMA."
"24","10","1","ceci n'est pas un 4 ou 5 étoiles design ou de luxe. Plutôt une rustique auberge - un peu vieillotte. "
"27","11","1","if you are looking for a centrally-located hotel in Bangkok that still offers a sanctuary from the busy streets, then this hotel was made for you. "
"34","14","1","Have a Crumbs cupcake (straight across Bryant Park on 41st).....one of the best in the City!

Other highlights are Restaurant Row (on 46th, west of Times Square), Two Little Red Hens & Sugar Sweet Sunshine (yes, more cupcakes!).

Have to see the Frick Collection!

Took Allstate Limo to and from the Newark Airport.  Efficient service....sure was better than taking the train with all of the luggage!"
