But if you need to stay near Columbus Circle and can get a good advance purchase rate (less than $200/night) it's totally worth it.

"93514","45047","1","Monday nights: sissy bingo in the bar."
"93517","45048","1","The hotel is incredibly loud, from both poor sound proofing between the rooms (yes Tammy in the next room did make some serious panting noises) and poorly sound proofed windows! The lower floors have excessive noise from the bars under The High Line (a squawking chorus of ladies singing badly at 2am) and the upper floors have the bass thumping through the ceiling from the club on the top floor. Not a problem if you're at either or like wearing ear plugs; the free pair of ""The Standard"" branded ear plugs in the bathroom should have given that away. So make sure you've not come to this hotel to relax or get much sleep. There may probably be a sweet spot around the 11th floor where the noise from below counteracts the noise from above but we didn't find it.

Don't expect to get a table at the restaurant, they don't keep tables for guests and if you wish to speak to the concierge be prepared for a 15 minute wait, I hung up eventually and just headed down the road to Barbuto for some great chicken eventually and managed to squeeze into the Standard Grill for a late brunch, no thanks to the hotel...

We had a little staycation here as we live in New York and we're not adverse to a bit of noise and a late night or ten but this hotel is worth avoiding unless you're from somewhere out of town where you're impressed with bad service and the boom boom... choose The Mark instead any day..."

"93852","45189","1","If you want to sleep, do NOT stay here. Between the loudness of the rooms at the courtyard and the street noise, you don;t have a chance of sleeping - which is why I'm typing this at 4am.

They don't do anything to allow their guests to sleep. People were loud in the courtyard from 3-4:30 AM, and with complaints from multiple people - they didn't make the guests stop their outdoor loud talking because they ""paid for their room and there was nothing they could do""."

"93906","45213","1","The pool area is small, so be sure to get there in the morning to reserve a chair.  Also, keep in mind that most chairs do not get sunlight after 1/2pm.  If you want to tan into the afternoon, take the lounge chairs across from the bar.   After 2pm, the scene tends to change to young wanna be rockers and hipsters.  Be prepared to pay a lot for drinks that tend to be weak. 

Avoid the overpriced breakfast by exploring the neighborhood's cafes.  Konditori is right next door to the hotel!  Even the deli at the corner of Allen and Stanton has cheap breakfast sandwiches.

"94454","45450","1","There is a second swimming pool if the Swim Club pool is too busy or filthy. The cocktails are delicious and the fried avocado is to die for."
"94457","45451","1","Don't expect typical hotel vibe - no ""lobby"" or activity.  "
"94466","45455","1","Worth it for a few days of relaxation in the country. There is very little to do in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, it is a 15minute taxi ride to the nearest town, this also means that you will eat all of your meals in the hotel."
"94469","45456","1","Ne pas hésiter: bien situé, bon rapport qualité / prix, taille correcte des chambres."
"94472","45457","1","Junior suites are quite large, space for couch, huge armchair, and have a kitchenette where you can cook."
"94475","45458","1","Get the top floor room with patio, it's well worth it, especially if you're staying a few days.  The other rooms are a bit small, but that's typical of hotels of that standing in european cities.  Also, the top floor room is high above the street noise.  "
"94480","45460","1","- A little far from the center of Florence. Not a big deal, but surrounding areas of the hotel are not super nice."
"94491","45465","1","Daikanyama books, an easy walk away, has a fantastic cafe."

"94502","45469","1","Worth it to ask them to order a boat for you!"
"94507","45471","1","Don't be put off by the location. While it is a bit far from the city center, the metro stop is very near. There are some cool areas within 10-15 min. walk...shops and restaurants (and a great little Mexican Restaurant near the train station). Do take advantage of the complimentary bikes and/or Mini. "

"94525","45479","1","Request an upgrade if possible.  I booked through Tablet Plus and got a bottle of French Wine and late check out (til 4pm).  They were supposed to offer 15% on their spa (but I didn't check)."

"94604","45512","1","The area around Almyra and Annabelle next door is trashy - lap dance club across the street and nasty strip clubs, dodgy touristy bars and cafes predominate. Unless that's your idea of a good time, don't do it."
"94609","45514","1","Have some cash on hand to tip the staff, since everything's a room charge so you don't deal with money directly"
"94614","45516","1","Very good breakfast included, and the concierge made excellent recommendations for restaurants."
"94617","45517","1","The hotel is close to the main train station so that area late at night is a little shady.  Take taxis to/from instead of walking.
The pro about being so close to the train station is that it provides a straight shot in just over 10 minutes to the airport."

"94755","45575","1","Eviter de prendre de le déjeuner dans le prix de votre chambre... il est juste affreux et pas du tout au niveau des tarifs de l'hôtel. Le parking pour voiture, c'est 40euros la journée ( même le personnel était navré du prix )... parquez-vous dans la rue.. ça vous en coûte 8 euros.
Le wifi est payant dans les chambres et gratuit dans le lobby.. Prenez une chambre au 1er, y a de forte chance que vous arriviez à utiliser ce dernier et vous éviter les 6 euros de connection par jour ou le forfait 15 euros pour 3 jours. "

"94802","45593","1","Consideren que para llegar a las habitaciones no pueden hacerlo en su auto, hay que dejar el auto en una zona especial y utilizar las camionetas del hotel. Esto significa que hay que avisar como 15 minutos antes de salir para que la camioneta esté esperándote."
"94809","45596","1","Go outside of August"
"94812","45597","1","The hotel restaurants and bars are more western prices, I would suggest venturing out and having the local food near the hotel. I enjoyed Au Lac Club. There is an ally way just outside the hotel where some of the best food in Hanoi is made. "

"94871","45622","1","Do yourself a favour and have the concierge book reservation at Kuzina restaurant for you, 8:00 pm and ask for the top terrace. It's a stunning sunset view of the Acropolis and the area, in a Michelin 2 star restaurant that is extremely affordable. You will not believe how stunning it is."

They were unable to make that distinction for us so I ended up having to speak to the manager and call tablet to get it resolved.  The pool area is small, so get there early if you want a seat.  "

"96288","46218","1","For morning coffee, I recommend 26 Cafe Lounge Bar.  It is located close to the hotel.  Situated one block from the beach on La Rambla, this cafe makes the best cappuccinos outside of Italy and they should since it is owned by an Italian.  Canopied by very old and interesting Banyan trees, the ambience is peaceful.  Linger as long as you like and watch Alicante locals socialize.  The service is always excellent (Spanish style) and they have numerous sandwiches other light food available.  The café comes to life at night with an amble bar available.

For a casual meal, I recommend Sale y Pepe located one street behind the hotel.  Sale y Pepe gives you the closest taste of truly Italian Pizza outside of Italy.  The menu consists of pastas and other dishes but the true delight is their pizza served by the meter.  In addition, this restaurant has two locations to select from depending on your mood.  Situation next to the cathedral, the old town location is full of charm and is a rather romantic setting.  On Saturdays during the summer, you are often treated to a peak at Alicante wedding parties at the cathedral and in the evenings there are always numerous street musicians to serenade you.  In addition, the owner often stops by dinners' tables to ensure that they are completely satisfied with their meal.

I had them call me a taxi and that taxi charges 150 pesos for two blocks!  It was my first day and eventhough I knew I was being ripped off I didn't have any point of reference."

Also, bear in mind this hotel is NOT in the city center so you are not near any cafes or stores ... you would need to take a taxi back into town or ride a bike for about 45 minutes to get into town.   So this is not a place for people who want to be in the center of the action.   It's more like a country inn.  "

Correcte de premier abord, la salle d'eau était une catastrophe,  le thermostat de notre douche était cassée et l'évacuation des eaux bouchée (brulures et inondation au programme).

Rent a car. No idea how you'd 'do' the area without one.

Head away from the coast (and the usual tourist areas) at least once. The mountains and the Guidana valley are beautiful."

It turns out there are several good Indian restaurants near by, and the food was really good. So, my advice is be a little adventurous, and try some good local Indian next time you are there."

Bethnal Green is a relatively un-explored area compare to the usual Oxford street, Mayfair, Kennsington. But the tube can basically take you anywhere, which is only 5 mins walk from Hotel. Walk east on Bethnal Green about 30min on a nice day and head towards Liverpool station, you will reach the lively Shoreditch district.  Check out Boxpark pop-up-store."
"97578","46763","1","The restaurant is pretty nice. Great food and ambience. They do give free WiFi.
Add $70 per  night easily to your room rate after tax ( during off season, I guess even more during peak summer and ski season). Eg. we booked room with breakfast, they don't have a buffet but specify a prefix meal for your breakfast which if you order you still have to pay a deductive billed amount which just doesn't make sense. Similarly they have other fees that you can't escape. Late check out is a big deal for them even if the hotel is empty."

Must eat at El Gordo, Divino, Campim Santho (sp)and the Sushi spot off the Quadrado.  I'd also recommend the Stand Up Paddle Boarding classes.  We rented bicycles b/c we enjoying tooling around town on a bike.  Also, definitely spend some time at the property's Club de Mare, great food and relaxing atmosphere."

Try out the Spanish Tapas restaurant if you are there for a while and have already tried out other restaurants.  While it doesn't compare the Michelin star hotels from Madrid or Barcelona it's a nice experience.
Careful with the prices.  We ordered the most expensive run-of-the-mill Gin and Tonic  that we've ever had anywhere in the world.  Henderson's has no right to cost $40 USD.  Just make sure you know what you are buying before ordering we learned at this hotel.
Make sure you walk to the park next door, up to Paulista Avenue and about 15 minutes walk away the shopping district of Oscar Friere."

"97870","46884","1","I had read reviews that warned about rooms that faced Melrose but have lived on main streets all my life, so this wasn't a concern for me.  I was transiting through LA with work and was desperate for a good nights sleep due to jet lag however it was a Saturday night and the bar was so loud that I could hear it through my walls and over the TV.  I had to go to sleep with my head phones in my ears, only to be woken up at 4:30am because someone decided to turn the TV on very loud in the lounge next to my room.  I called the front desk and they turned it off very quickly but if sleep is precious to you and going out partying isn't the reason you're in LA, consider requesting a room as far away from the bar area as possible."

It was extremely difficult to navigate your path around the health club which spans multiple floors and various confusing doors.  Hence leading to me walking into the men's (!) changing room only to encounter a gaggle of tan, naked, SHAVED Italian men who proceeded to laugh at the horror on my face.  Which is fine because I always assumed the reaction i'd receive would be laughter when confronted with a tan, shaved, naked Italian man.

Housekeeping does a seriously fantastic job but note that they visit quite frequently (three times in one day that I happened to be there; who knows about the other days); so if it's privacy and rest you're after, make sure to keep the DND sign on the door."

I stayed in the a suite that absolutely reeked of mold from under the tub, unfortunately the tub was in the middle of the room so I was unable to escape it. I complained and asked the switch rooms, I was told there were none available. I was forced to sleep out on the balcony because the smell was unbearable.
I stayed at 6 other hotels whilst in Tuscany and they all were clean and tenable, Hotel Home was a huge disappointment.

The beaches just across the park are as good as sandy as you're going to find anywhere in the area, so you won't need a car to get to the beach.

Santorini is more ""done"" than other areas of Greece (like the Peloponnese region - which is pristine and just amazing. I recommend Gerolimenas and a hotel called Kyrimai).  Santorini  caters to travelers and knows how to profit from tourists - the items in the shops are not unique or authentic - kind of like being in Times Square NYC.  The most quaint area is Oia by far.  It has breath taking views and smaller, more charming shops and cute restaurants. If you go to Santorini definitely stay in Oia!"

One thing I find annoying (stayed twice), is the long wait for elevators going up and down to hotel room.

The hotel was recently renovated, so it had great modern features with the charm if a historic hotel (which it is). It also has a beautiful garden that you walk through on the way to/from town. While it has great 180 degree views if Napoli Bay, it is also right in the middle of Sorrento. Restaurants and shopping are right outside the property. Nevertheless, the property still feels very private. The service was absolutely first-class, from the concierge to the restaurant staff. I travelled through Italy for three weeks and stayed in 5-star hotels all over the country, and this hotel was my favorite! Highly recommend!"

Only thing to point out that the hotel area is a quiet place, which is ok, because you want rest and relaxation at a hotel.

Little to no amenities - literally a place to sleep. 

Rooms are small, but cozy. I stayed in the Mini Cabane and the bed is the majority of the room. 

I visited in November and the room was very cold when I walked in - there's a thermostat in every room, so just need to adjust to the right temperature. Took 30-45 minutes for the room to warm up. 

Great modern, oyster/raw bar restaurant across the street - Clamato. Easy walk to Le Marais and around the city.

Although the hotel is very close to the tram, it is on a very steep hill, so if you have any disability that makes it difficult to go up and down a very steep road with not much pavement space, you might want to take that into consideration. 
Otherwise, I would say this is a fantastic place to stay- entirely worth the price, which I think is actually rather moderate comparing it to other hotels in other destinations. 
Also, do your homework- Istanbul is an amazing city and if you really read up about it, you will discover there are loads of things to do and experience. "

"102878","48978","1","While this hotel has style, it also has an over crowding issue.  The pool is filled with children, I didn't bother to use it in the end, you can't even do a lap.  There's a queue for check in, and queue for dining.  It just has too many rooms and not enough facilities to provide a 5 star experience.  The service was sub par.   I expect higher standards for a hotel at this level.  From rubbish in the corridors, to house keeping walking in on my room while I was in bed (despite requesting late check out), to inroom dining not clearing away plates upon request; it's just not up to scratch. Pity, as the rooms are excellent."

"102971","49019","1","Highly recommend one to take the tram. It's incredibly cheap at only HKD2.3 and it's a really good way to see HK Island. It passes through Causeway Bay, Wan Chai and Central.

- Bu Tao ramen
- Yung Kee (roast goost)
- Tsui Wah
- Lan Fong Yuen (local breakfast)
- Lin Heung (for a very local dim sum experience)
- For Kee (pork chop rice)

1) Ask the hotel to turn on the TV in the room(s) next to yours and test how loudly you'll hear them. We came midweek so it was only on the Saturday we left when someone was in the room nextdoor with the TV on. It might have been a deal-breaker, had we experienced it our first night.

2) Before you accept the room, turn on the heater/fan. Ours was very loud. We're used to a loud heater, as our furnace at home could wake the dead, but we were disappointed to find it in our luxury hotel ""escape."""

"106076","50341","1","Don't stay here if you want a true sandy beach experience. This is not for ocean swimming as it's very shallow and filled with plants. You are extremely isolated here with expensive transport back to the town, no way to explore the Caye on land beyond walking a dirty trail along the water. The hotel will need to realize they should provide free transfers to town so people will want to stay longer at their hotel. Dinner options at other locales should not cost $80 in transport fees. They should also have a better way to get you to great snorkeling and swimming which is what we went here for but got very little of. Despite the greatness of Belize, will not be back to this hotel."

I found this ridiculous for the guests, since some people need to keep any items in the fridger or take something out to see what they have. The hotel didn't charge me at the end, but this auto-charged bill underneath my door totally threw me off! Will never go back to this place."

The breakfast is super good too."

Costo della colazione attorno ai 30 USD in una atmosfera da bar medio basso).

Prepare for a BIG breakfast, it's amazing and it is served wherever you feel most comfortable (we set up outside our room on the balcony, looking over the central courtyard). Don't miss the terrace upstairs at night and in the sun! Try out the outside key before you get back late at night, it's a bit stiff (although someone is always around to open). Ask about being picked up from - or dropped off to - the airport: the drive is easy and comfortable with the hotel's driver. "

"107800","51066","1","Great stay if you are looking for a quiet, spacious hotel in the French Concession. Try the breakfast at least once or twice - its included. Decor is historic / old Shanghai. Location is somewhat hidden of the main areas, and is surrounded by worn-down buildings but everything is still a short hop away via taxi or a 15 minute walk to metro stops on Huahai Middle road."
"107803","51067","1","The neighborhood quiets down pretty well, but is a short walk from Central and points further. Sheung Wan also has many great local eats like Yardbird, etc. Overall, a good place for extended stay as it is an apartment hotel. What it lacks in hotel services it makes up in living comfort. "

"107855","51090","1","Just know what you are getting into. 
My tight jeans and Ray Bans don't make me cool enough for this place. I am too old (35) and by now I appreciate good service above the mandatory tats and bad attitude. 
Before booking, make sure you check on private parties being planned for the weekend as you will have to enjoy part of it. 
The Ace is not worth 400$ a night and I am surprised it is still on Tablet. 
Again, attitude is not something we should remember from a hotel stay. "

I also felt like I got the WORST room - probably because I came to the hotel using a ""deal"". I don't blame them for not saving their best rooms for travelers like me.

"108379","51314","1","VERY IMPORTANT: There are no doors in the hotel rooms to close - no bathroom doors, no shower doors, it is one open room with a toilet and a shower inside the room, divided by an open wall.  Be aware of this before you arrive.  There is a huge vertical climb (all the way up a mountain) to get to and from the hotel to the beach, it is not easy to do, and the hotel does have shuttles that are very infrequent and hard to get.  Really did not feel that this place was worth the money, felt like the room was out of the 1970's and needs a large upgrade.  Beautiful settings and beautiful sunsets, but sub-par rooms, and I wish we knew this before booking our stay.  "

Generously tip each who have served you at the end of your stay - they deserve it! You can tell them upfront that you'll tip at the end to make it easier on yourself, otherwise you'll be tipping non-stop for their consistently outstanding service. I was recommended by an experienced Frenchman in Morocco to tip a minimum of 50 Dirhams per person per day, remembering if you eat at the riad that you would normally be giving a 10-12 percent tip at the restaurants for your meals. An exception would be to tip upfront 10-20 dirhams per day for each of the cleaners, who will give you great in-room service."

Lighting is not the best in your room (especially in bathroom) to ensure they keep the ambience so you might want to use your phone light.

It is right in the heart of ocean beach and is accessible to all the restaurants and stores surrounding it. It is also a block away from Collins avenue. If you're looking for a place to stay that is right in the center of south beach this is it. It was comfortable, the service was great and everyone went above and beyond to help.

"110309","52134","1","i think tablet's review/comments of:  ""And a well-made hotel it is — possibly the finest small hotel we have come across, and certainly the coolest"" are COMPLETELY MISLEADING.  my partner and i have stayed in many other tablet hotels before, and this hotel does NOT meet this claim.  for one, the hotel felt a bit outdated.  it seems as though they've made no updates since they won the 2004 wallpaper design award.  for instance, our bedroom/bathroom walls were scuffed up all over the place.  the rooms (we stayed in two) although cool because they mixed traditional japanese and modern elements, all had bad lighting, NO ventilation (we couldn't open our windows to let fresh air in in one of our rooms), and could be noisy due to the bus depot outside.  
the hotel itself just lacked the overall character and design aesthetic that i have grown accustomed to going to tablet hotels.  the lobby i guess i was kinda cool with the restaurant, but that was about it.  the hotel offered really no extra amenities like fitness, pool, spa, game room, even a bar.  the ""bar"" was just a bar (that no one sat at) at the restaurant...even their ""roof top"" felt completely unfinished, like there was no reason to go up there!
further, and this goes without saying, the location was EXTREMELY inconvenient to the transit lines.  one really needs to take a bus to get to the JR/subways.  the area of meguro is definitely cool, but would only suggest staying here for a seasoned tokyo traveler who does not need to do any touristy activities.  
the standout aspects of this hotel is the good food at the restaurant and the cool shop ""do"" on the second floor.  
finally, as alluded to earlier, i think tablet's review is really exaggerated.  i rely on tablet's opinion on hotels like this one, and really felt mislead and disappointed.  "

The lobby has a great work space with several tables and wifi availability.  Check out the Comedy Cellar around the corner!  Also, Otto has amazing Italian food.  Last but not least, make sure you have enough time to get to the airport (note:  LaGuardia is much closer than JFK!)"

"111267","52537","1","Know these things before you book this hotel-

1. There is no air conditioning. So during the warm season your room feels like an oven. The fans they provide do not help. If you keep your windows open, the noise from the street below and the mosquitoes will keep you up all night.

2. The hotel is centrally located but it is very noisy at night. 

3. The bathroom (at least in the room we stayed in) does not have a door and if you are sharing the room, there is no privacy.

4. The service at the front desk leaves a lot to be desired. 

5. If you ask for the hotel to hail you a cab, the price will already be set depending on where you are going. It is safer to have the hotel call a cab for your rather than getting one yourself off the street but know that you will be paying an arm and a leg for the cost of getting to say, Polanco. "

"112417","53026","1","You may want to reconsider any ""upgrades"" to an outside facing room as the noise from the revelers in the street below might cause loss of beauty sleep. The Madrilenos keep on partying well into the daylight. The courtyard rooms, despite having zero view,  are much quieter. Also avoid the rooms higher up. The 7th floor turns into a bar/club late at night."

Breakfast selection is little and not as expectation.
Cafe room is old.

Not satisfied for a luxury 5 star hotel. "

"112884","53222","1","Though the pool itself was fairly nice it is a bit of a hike down to the restaurant and lobby without a connecting pathway.  So a room by the pool requires a hike down the road to get to the more central parts of the hotel."

2. Ask Andrea to arrange a day boat charter to Capri.

"115808","54466","1","this is a party hotel and not suitable for a business trip or family or vacation."
"115811","54467","1","Unbedingt den complementary bicycle-service nutzen - New York mit dem Fahrrad bietet ungeahnte Möglichkeiten. Die Fahrräder sind zwar nicht so gut gewartet wie die ctibikes, die es an fast jeder Straßenecke gibt, aber dafür umsonst und für einen kürzeren Ausflug völlig ok."
"115822","54472","1","Rent a scooter for your stay. It's the best way to move around Barcelona. We used Vesping. "

Stay away from floor 23 - already noisy and lounge was not even open."
"115838","54479","1","Very nice, stylish but not over-done boutique hotel. If you are looking for very large, spacious rooms, this might not be for you. Rooms are great, but cozy. Great area and a block from South Kensington Tube stop. Very happy with my stay and would stay there again."

"115866","54492","1","Book a dinner at Comptoir - the show they put on, on a Saturday night is unbelievable!

There is an incredible 3-floor store (really a massive, single-store souk) on the road to Riad 72... the staff will know where to direct you. Make sure you check it out before wandering into the souks. It gives you a great idea for what you can find in the souks and they have some of the coolest furniture and decor pieces I've seen recently!"
"115871","54494","1","Really, it's just about location, it's right in the center of Shibuya where all the action is but besides the view, I was surprised that Tablet listed it as one of its recommendations,"
"115878","54497","1","The location is absolutely brilliant, right next to everything but just off the hustle & bustle and the touristy bits."

"115884","54499","1","Spa facilities are great."
"115887","54500","1","Realize that breakfast isn't included, and the one that is offered is close to $45 US per person."
"115890","54501","1","I'm not sure what the other rooms or floors were like but we would definitely recommend staying on the top floor! Be sure to ask for recommendations on places to eat."
"115893","54502","1","Hotel is conveniently located but not a high profile hotel, so it is fairly unassuming from first impression. We were in a large room and we're quite comfortable. Some construction on adjacent properties as of June 2014."
"115900","54505","1","The beach club is 5 minutes at the sister hotel, where you pay 30 Euros a day for a lounger. One one side, the Juana is very close to a residential building. Juan-les-Pins is very built-up, not the place for a beach walk. "

"115939","54522","1","Location is not within walking distance of any of the major tourist sights. The rooms are unbearably small and cramped."
"115942","54523","1","Bei einem Aufenthalt von mehreren Tagen würde ich ein Loggia-Zimmer empfehlen! Schöne Aussicht auf die Innenstadt von Graz, Morgensonne, Retro-Liegestühle am Balkon laden zu einem längeren Aufenthalt ein.  "

"116001","54548","1","Hotel is in a residential area - short walk from downtown.  Most cabs never heard of the hotel so be sure to have the cross streets.  Friday night the lobby turns into a night club - good or bad depending on what you are looking for."
"116010","54552","1","We enjoyed our stay. The design style and amenities are well thought through and very enjoyable. The rooms are well appointed with anything you might need.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.
Make sure to have good clear directions if you are arriving after dark especially and not familiar with the area. "

"116083","54582","1","Stay as far from the pool as possible if you want quiet time. 
Oh, and the staff also told me "" You should book through us directly next time rather than Tablet. We can take care of you better"" 
So maybe you shouldn't book this hotel through Tablet to begin with."
"116088","54584","1","Well located for Guggeheim and located between 2 vaporetto stops, so only one stop from San Marco."
"116093","54586","1","The Legian is great for that special occasion, and the service is excellent.  There are equally good spots nearby at half the price however.  "

"116150","54611","1","The hotel is in a very touristy end of ChinaTown. There is a pub across the road that was 
very loud untill well into the earlie hours. 
Location is fine for seeing the soho area but don't expect to get an undisrupted nights sleep. "
"116153","54612","1","More like a European hotel -- small rooms, efficient with not much storage space. Yet the location near Time Warner Center, Columbus Circle subway station, Lincoln Center -- and within walking distance of many good restaurants and Broadway theaters make it hotel worth considering."
"116156","54613","1","Because I booked through Tablet, I got free wifi every night of our stay (normally $10 per night)."
"116161","54615","1","The hotel is well located and within walking distance of the downtown arts district.  there are some restaurants near by and Golds Gym on McKinney Ave.  So well located."
"116164","54616","1","I was in New York during a particularly busy week, and was unable to get a view of the park. I imagine a good view would enhance the stay immensely. The other side of the hotel stares at an unremarkable office building. Also, if in the mood for a massage, go with the in-room option. The day-spa they sent me to wasn't very nice."
"116169","54618","1","book in advance. excellent location"

"116201","54632","1","The recently opened Ham Yard Hotel (also by Firmdale) is located only a few blocks away and may be a nicer property to stay at. They were offering discount opening rates when I visited London which I wish I knew in advance of my trip. "

"116235","54647","1","If you want alcohol, you will only find it in restaurants and not in cafes.
When walking to sights, ignore the locals when they tell you 'it is closed today', it's a scam!  Don't accept a guide to your destination from a local unless (a) you want to pay, and (b) you're happy being taken around in a circle and dumped.
Despite how it seems, it is very safe."

"116256","54655","1","Don't bother with the suite, it is not worth the phenomenal price tag. The ""sofa"" was a wooden bench and the fireplace is aesthetic only. We only used the upstairs bedroom and the downstairs area was a waste of money. "
"116263","54658","1","Breakfast is outrageously expensive if you don't have an appetite "

"116294","54671","0","The first room we were shown was dark, small and would have been less than ideal. We were staying 9 days and would not have accepted that.

"116321","54681","1","There is not a lot of room for luggage......"
"116328","54684","1","This is located right by the Buda Castle. It is very charming, with cobblestone streets. With that said, it is very confusing to gain entree to this area by car.....you have to go through certain gates, which tend to be closed at certain times. It is advisable to call the hotel as you near the area to have them direct you."
"116337","54688","0","Nur für Familien mit Kindern geeignet, Singles oder Paare ohne Kinder sind hier fehl am Platz. "
"116340","54689","1","More youth hostel than hotel. Honestly. Paper cups and plastic ware in room service. Problems with noise control, water pressure, window treatment malfunctions. The housekeeping kept waking me up every morning talking loudly in the hallway. Poor service. Lots of calls to various service departments that don't get answered. No follow up. The blinds would not open and I kept asking for them to get changed. Never happened. Constantly bringing up the wrong room service order. The place is a mess. For that price point it is not worth it. Better of paying a bit more for a nicer hotel or less for a more affordable yet comfortable hotel."

"116418","54720","1","wait at least 3 months from this date to stay here, construction will wake  you up.
The price is not reflected on service and hospitality, I would recommend to either pay a big more and get a more decent deal or pay less and get what you pay for. Not very happy at all."

"116440","54728","1","Their breakfast at the Americano is delicious. Their rooftop bar has great drinks and view at night, while their poolside view (albeit a personal sized pool) is great during the day. It's right by Highline Park, so definitely take advantage of that. The hotel is chic from entrance to rooftop, so if you appreciate the little things in design and value top notch customer service, definitely book your stay here. "
"116449","54732","1","Good location when attending events at the RAI"
"116452","54733","1","This is a Japanese chain hotel, which means that the facilities will not be top notch but service impeccable. They made one minor mistake, and they sent the manager up for apologising. Twice."

Bring a few bottles of champagne with you and relax while taking in the gorgeous views during the day or the night stars.  The nearby quaint village of Paia has a few good restaurants, shops and bars, and there's a great organic market called Mana Foods.  It's also a super place from which to hit the road to Hana or to pop up to the summit of Heleakala.  There are no TV's or telephones, but with cell phones and a free wireless network, who needs them?  Until Aman arrives in Maui (and perhaps even after!), Lumeria will be our choice."

We charted our drives to take back roads and were happy to spend a little extra time as the scenery -- village and country -- was outstanding.  We stayed here while visiting Bayeux and the D-Day beaches, both 1.25 to 1.5 hours away.  It was worth the distance to enjoy the Chateau.  In order to enjoy the space and the region's fine wine, we suggest breakfast at the Chateau, a main meal of lunch while out, and gathering some light picnic provisions to enjoy at the Chateaux in the evening.  While there are restaurants in nearby villages, it was nice not to drive to and from dinner.  "

"119184","55869","1","Ask about the sonsen place for lunch - I think it's called Hori-bun or something like that, but be sure to get there a little early!  We arrived at 12:30 and had to wait about 2 hours to eat, though waiting on a river was very enjoyable and we probably could have visited the shrine and shops nearby while we waited.  Our stay with Ugenta was fantastic though.  At the end of our dinner, we were getting pretty full and they asked us if we'd like them to make rice balls for us with the rest of the dish for later.  Those were a tasty snack.  Go ahead and store your luggage and walk around a bit if you arrive before check in - there's a surprising amount of things to see for such a small town."
"119193","55873","1","This hotel is exactly what you would expect from a boutique hotel, very funky, cool, and a great atmosphere. Highly recommended! The staff was friendly and helpful. Big bonus is that this hotel is walking distance from everything touristy about New Orleans, which was perfect for our holiday. The only taxi we had to take was to and from the airport, which was a flat rate of $33, seriously cheap!! Will stay again!"

"119263","55903","1","Tener paciencia con el personal de la piscina,son brutos sin información adecuada para dar un servicio de cinco estrellas,preguntan cada rato que vayas a la piscina s estas alojado en el hotel,muy molestos."
"119266","55904","1","Nearby restaurants, Bumpkin for twists on trad. British cooking  and The Margaux for tasty and slightly innovative French are good restaurant bets."
"119273","55907","1","Try the breakfast buffet. A little pricey (30 euros) but sometimes they have a promotion to use a visa and get free daily breakfast! Totally worth it!"
"119276","55908","1","I thought I would love the location but the front is right off a main road (not such a big deal) because the main thing was the ocean view from the rooms.
I thought the kids could get their feet wet in the water by the hotel but a big sign says water contaminated.
It was hot and there was no air conditioning
which would be fine with the patio door open EXCEPT for the horn that blares every 10 seconds ALL night long, I guess to warn ships.
After one night we did find earplugs in the drawer but I was afraid to put both in in case someone came in through the screen door as we were on the ground floor.
It really seems like I should have had some warning about the horn, it ruined being near the water for us.
Decor is more dated than other Tablet hotels I have stayed in. Also, they consider one room with fold out couch in it a suite. Maybe you know this, but I was expecting something more.
I could never recommend this hotel because of the constant blaring horn."

The breakfast offered a good selection, and whilst still pricy, not as expensive as some hotel breakfasts can be. The ""half breakfast"" is a good option. 

The pool is worth a visit for a morning dip. "

We really enjoyed the morning tour of the rice paddies as well. The guide was very knowledgeable, and he led us on a less strenuous path due to the number of children on our tour."

"119618","56055","1","Outstanding location.  Much quieter than if we had stayed in center city yet a short walk through the lovely botanic gardens to all of the Sydney sites.  The  hotel design and views were brilliant.  The value for the price was also outstanding.  The Wooloomooloo wharf area is up and coming and there were several outstanding and fun restaurants adjacent to the hotel. Overall, exceeded all of my expectations!"
"119623","56057","1","Weather lends enchantment to the view. Choose a sunny period to go there.
We did not have much luck with the weather but then we had no choice because the date was set in stone.

"119677","56079","1","Be ready for very minimalist hard surface interiors, and that even if you have a Ph.D in electrical engineering you will never figure out the light switches.  Booking a car service to MXP through the hotel is a bargain. Go to Rinasciente, the department store across the street, it is great, and the top floor restaurants are way better than you would ever think they would be."

"119885","56169","1","This hotel is in a great location for many things. Five minutes to the Getty. Close to the beach in Santa Monica and not far from attractions like Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and Universal. The downside is that it is not walking distance to anything! While it has a lovely restaurant with great views, if you want a quick and reasonable cup of coffee or breakfast or more variety in foods and ambiance, you need to drive there. After a day of sightseeing, and not wanting to brave traffic again and deal with local parking just to eat dinner somewhere else, we used the restaurants in Brentwood a lot because that was the closest option."

"120457","56407","1","Room Service, bar, lobby drinks are insanely overpriced.  This was the biggest shame, because it would have been nice to enjoy the live music in the lobby with some drinks, but $22 a beer was far above what I was willing to pay."
"120464","56410","1","Hotel is perfect for a 20 something year old on business.  This hotel is cheap for a reason, you get a bed and a bathroom and not much else.  Don't let that fool you though, it's still a very pleasant stay.  Very good location for Southwark (close to the tube, london bridge train station, restaurants, the Shard).  Hotel staff is friendly.  The ""cheap"" rooms can start adding up though as just about everything is charged extra.   "

The only thing that in the guest bathrooms there are no hooks for clothing or for the towels.  Just some minor little details of convenience when you travel. The soap holder in the shower does not drain so all if your products sit in water with no additional space for your toiletries.   There are not a lot of electrical outlets throughout the room to charge your devices. But overall. A really lovely place to stay.  And very quiet considering how close the hotel is such very public areas. "

"120719","56511","1","Avoid this hotel at all costs: Spotty service, bad housekeeping (no robes!), need to ring bell for access after midnight, my room's door opened outward (weird), car parking squeezed,  useless ancient elevator (stairs or wait forever), non-sea view bland, no terraces, internet was disaster and when we commented they just said there must be many people online!

The so called pool is also quite depressing.

This is pretty much the last time I trust Tablet's curated selection."
"120722","56512","1","Very young crowd, fun parties and atmosphere.
This is a hotel to mingle, and have fun.

"120788","56540","0","GOOD locations rooms are small"
"120793","56542","1","There is a lovely cafe I discovered, only a 5 minute walk from the hotel, called ""aT"", that serves fresh soups, salads, sandwiches and amazing juices/smoothies! All natural, acai berries, kale, etc ... it's in Piazza de Pietra, #62,  which is off of Via del Corso (where hotel is), the cross street leading to Piazza is Via di Pietra. It's a nice alternative to all the pasta and pizza cafés you find everywhere. And it's a couple of minutes away from the Pantheon also.

Another gem next to hotel is Origini Gelateria, all organic, authentic flavors, so so good! Keep in mind that most of the Gelaterias you're going to find in Rome are commercial and ""fast food"", full of artificial colorings and nasty preservatives. This was a lovely find, I went back every night on my way walk back to hotel, it's a 2 min walk, on Via Piè di Marmo, which you get to through Via Lata (literally facing hotel) and then through Piazza del Collegio Romano.  "

"120829","56558","1","Stay at ZaZa instead.  I'm shocked this is  Tablet Hotel.  I couldn't sleep because I could hear every word of phone calls all night long from our neighbor (the walls are that thin).  The bed was also pretty bad."
"120834","56560","1","Area of hotel is lovely but be prepared to walk or take taxis to tourist attractions. Warsaw is quite spread out."
"120837","56561","1","note the $20 charge for parking!"
"120846","56565","1","Double rooms are bigger, but there are queens  (one or two per floor -- the 03's are for sure) that are same size as doubles.  Regular queen is small but not bad for NY."
"120855","56569","1","It’s closer to the city center than you would think. Bethnal Green tube (Zone 2), a short walk down the street, is on the Central Line, just 7 stops from Oxford Circus. The hotel also has a free morning shuttle to the City and to Canary Wharf."
"120862","56572","1","Try their library... Its only open to hotel guests!"
"120865","56573","1","Note that this is not a full fledged hotel (I.e. No spa, pool, breakfast, etc), it leans more towards a serviced apartment concept. As long as you do not require the typical 5-star hotel add-ons you will have a great stay."

"120976","56621","1","Splurge on a larger room. "
"120981","56623","1","We followed the advice of some reviewers who recommended a higher floor for a quieter experience. And it was quiet. However, it actually wasn't very loud on the ground floor even on a Friday night, so I don't think that's much of a concern.  If you're spending more time in town on the day you check out of Jade, they will store your luggage for you at no cost (other than tipping the guys who do the lugging)."

"121003","56631","1","L'hôtel est loin à pied, donc si vous n'avez pas de passe transport, Il faudra bien marcher 30 minutes (à bonne vitesse). 
Les chambres peu chères sont vraiment très (trop) vétustes, même pas de bouilloire, la douche à part et la TV n'en parlons pas (autant ne pas en avoir). Par contre la wifi capte très bien, et les lits sont suffisamment confortables pour le prix! 
La salle commune est grande et confortable, mais la proximité du restaurant (même pièce) et les prix affichés n'en font pas le meilleur lieu de repos.
Gros avantage, vous êtes à l'écart de la ville, donc très peu de bruits la nuit! (du côté ""mer"" en tout cas)
Bref correct si vous payez pas trop chère ! "

Hotel currently under construction -- you might want to request an already renovated room.  Front desk staff not equally knowledgeable regarding public transportation and can send you on the wrong bus, subway or train thus eating up valuable time so double check directions.  Taxis to and from airport can be expensive (up to $400 one way).  The cost should be around $110.  At the airport they have kiosks that allow you to punch in where you want to go and they give you a set price and send the taxi to pick you up -- great technology.

I would suggest checking this place out though- all the locals hang out here and you can have beer and cheap pizza when the kitchen is closed at the hotel. 
The hotel does not serve any food during the midday break- be aware of this. If you are driving around it would be a good idea to stop in a shop and grab some snacks. They do serve drinks all day though. 

The little town is full of bodegas, we were told there are 45. We weren't able to schedule a visit to a local one but definitely tried the wines and they were some of the best. 

Overall this boutique hotel is a great spot when exploring the rioja region!

If it's your first time in Tokyo, pick somewhere in Shibuya, if you are a regular Tokyo visitor, you can get over the slight awkwardness of the location, it's about 5 mins in a cab from Meguro station or 10mins in a cab from wonderful Nakameguro."

Reminder to self, old hotels are wonderful and so you need to be reminded that it is just that a small boutique inn and not a five star hotel. Bring your ear plugs and enjoy the experience of staying in one of our older cities and mansions. Check with Heather on rooms and study closely the reviews and layout of rooms and what street that they are facing.  It will make all the difference in the world."

Also, get the previous name of the hotel from the staff so you can use it with cabbies. Nobody knows ""The Hyatt"" in Bangalore, and Indians have a hard time understanding that word when you say it. "

"124604","58144","1","Location is not ideal for exploring cools areas of Tokyo which are at least a 30-40 minute train ride away or very expensive tax ride. On the flip side, hotel is close to train stop and in the historic area."
"124607","58145","1","Don't book because of hotel's ""cool design"".  Despite recent redesign the hotel already feels a bit tired. The location is a winner and the staff is solid. Decent option for base camp to explore Hong Kong, but not a cool trendy hotel with exceptional design notes. "

While this has nothing on hotels in Miami Beach, quieter rooms are located at the back of the hotel, although they are a bit darker. I enjoyed the location in front as we had a balcony and it was fun to step outside onto it and watch the Torinese."

The most popular nightlife spot in Sweden is located on the ground floor with very loud music and revelry going late into the night. However, if that interests you, then this is THE place to stay.

Like most Tablet Hotels, it's non-traditional but the beds and linens were good and all around a good deal.  Food seemed a bit pricey as you can get some really great meals and tapas at other places with more charm, but the garden was pleasant to have a drink after a long day of site seeing."

Our suite was very clean but very dark - kind of depressing - not luxurious.  This hotel is towards the back of the French Quarter so be careful at night. "

"125101","58352","1","I really wanted to like this hotel.  The location is great, and the public spaces are beautiful... but then there is staff... no idea that they are in the hotel business.  Also, nobody bothered to mention to them that they are a tablet plus property...  

Upgrade?  I've heard nothing about this.   Glass of wine on arrival, a polite laugh and nod, but nothing ever appeared on the second ask, so we gave up.  Late check out?  Absolutely not (and after showing the desk manager the print out from his own reservation form, he agreed, but when we returned at 2 he was IN OUR ROOM, stuffing things into our bags).  

The first 2 rooms smelled so strongly of mold that my wife insisted that we take a downgrade to a smaller room which had a less strong smell, though the tiles in the bathroom had black slime in the grout and the sheets had gray spotted mold stains (though they had been washed and did not smell... they ought to have been replaced).

I have some compassion that this is a very old (and wonderfully stylish!) building and that the currency crisis may have prevented management from having the money to properly renovate the tiles... but they should have at least been bleached... and the staff should be informed of hotel policies.

Pass on this one unless you have a very high tolerance for trading style for hygiene and competence.  "

Also, La Minervetta arranged a private tour of Pompeii with Raffael (sp?) - he was one of the best guides we have ever had and spent over 4 hours with us.  Take the train there from Sorrento - simple and quick.

For over $400 per night, our rooms were tired, carpet and drapes were filthy and worn, furniture was chipped with huge gouges.   In particular, the carpet in the hallways and also in our room were worn and filthy, we wore shoes while inside our room!   To top it off, rooms were not cleaned until after 4:30pm.   After a long day of touring coming into a room that hasn't been cleaned was extremely upsetting.   One day our room wasn't cleaned at all.   They gave us a free glass of wine to compensate us.

I might have chosen something on Ocean Dr. rather then Collins, as this is the part of the strand that you more think of as south beach.  A lot of the smaller boutique, art deco hotels are here.  They are all situated on the boardwalk with outside tables and restaurants all along the beach. When you stay at one of the hotels on Collins Ave, you still get the same awesome beach but the hotels are bigger and you a little further removed from this area.  Your still close to everything like great restaurants, shopping etc. its just a different feel.  Definitely try Havana 1857, a great Cuban food recommendation from our concierge.  I'd skip a visit to the Design District. Although there are tons of upscale shops, its still under quite a bit of construction.  "

The location is great, the rooms are quiet, and the subway is close and convenient. Lots of good restaurants nearby, and it's easy to get a taxi. Very safe neighborhood. If you've stayed there long enough, you know you can request a fish (in a fishbowl) in your room to keep you company. I always do. Rooms are small, but that is NYC.

Mar Mikhail, a leisurely walk away, is great for bars and cafes. The Sursock Museum is gorgeous, although always seems to be under renovation. That's a short walk away too. Definitely venture from Beirut...Byblos in the north is a beautiful port city and the Cedars are a must. I love the Roman ruins in Baalbeck but due to its location in the Bekka Valley, it's not always an alluring attraction for tourists (and there are a few great wineries out that way too).

It's japan after all and service is defined as discreet and refined. What you WILL get is the perfect mix of that typical Andaz ""howdie"" from America and the more reserved japanese aesthetic. For me, it's the perfect mix: a boutique feel with exceedingly high standards of service without the level of pretentiousness that usually goes with it. "

This is like an old hotel in Honolulu Hawaii that is trying to be a four star but is really a three star.  I am shocked it made the leading hotels of the world. I'm shocked Tablet have it such high ratings and have me expectations. Tablet is usually good with the ratings. But they really missed this one. The hotel is old and outdated. The keys don't work, I had to change them twice. The service is so so.  This is a hotel I would recommend to the not so traveled traveler.

Also, the hotel is on a compound surrounded by 2 relatively low end all inclusive resorts.  So the vibe is super nice at the hotel, but the surrounding area lacks any charm. That said, there's not really any charm for miles!  Cabarete is a great beach with a cool vibe but it's a 30 min and $80 (back and forth) car ride away!  "

The view of the Empire Street Building from the chic 22nd floor bar is wonderful and well worth a visit. Finally - rooms are terrific but typically a bit New York small - so spring for a larger room if you can afford it."

Pop down to the Biergarten in the late afternoon for a quick bite and a beer, or call an audible and get hooked on the mulled wine. Late night, start with drinks at the Top of the Standard (Boom Boom Room) and enjoy some of the best views of the city at the same time.

"131264","60956","1","The entrance looks residential and is a little tricky to find.  Our driver wasn't familiar with the hotel so he drove around the neighborhood for a while, asking cab drivers which way to go before he found it.  I'd recommend that you print out a map before your arrival because it is much easier to locate with a map than trying to find street signs and addresses on buildings."

We ordered a variety of tapas to eat, some good some not so good, ie the patatas bravas, weren't cooked enough and not hot enough. I aslo think the tables aren't designed for eating food, more for drinks and I think when taking bookings they should explain this.
The staff were polite and friendly in the rooftop bar but i think the minimum spend criteria is over the top given the style of the bar and the ok good. You cannot fault the location though, so it's a real shame the food and tables werent the same.

Your free wifi will really be just a voucher for 500M of internet from some 3rd party service. This in theory is fine, except most devices when connected to wifi assume it's time to download updates, sync all kinds of stuff, etc. If your devices do this, that 500M will be done in a few moments. We were there for 3 days and we got to check email on one of those days. So the tip is that you need to configure all your devices to block all of those normally ok features before you connect to wifi. "

"131942","61241","1","The restaurant Maiolino had great brunch and dinner (call the Concierge ahead of your stay to book dinner at Maiolino because it books up way in advance and they can find a way to squeeze you in). The Rose Bar is really hopping and apparently if you are not a guest of the hotel it's tough to get in but we made a reservation via the concierge and breezed right in which was fun since we are normally not the exclusive club hopping type. Music at the Rose Bar was excellent and so were the drinks. We also went to a place about two blocks away called Dear Irving one night which is a speakeasy style bar -- I recommend that as well. Great vibe and more mellow than Rose Bar.  Other places we ate that weekend included Narcissa (delicious, creative food) and Blue Hill (farm to table prix fixe menu, fancy but not pretentious) and brunch at Essex which is $25 for 3 drink brunch (mimosa, bloody mary or screwdriver)  and delicious food (make a reservation).  It was all really great and I recommend checking those places out. "

"132074","61298","1","Rooms are not nearly nice enough to justify the price. We had no interest in spending any time outside of sleeping or showering in this room, even though it was an upgraded King. Location is great, but overall not worth the price tag."
"132081","61301","1","There is a strong party scene at this hotel.  It regularly hosts EDM parties going until 3am, hundreds of people, drugs, etc. This might have been related to a music festival going on all along the Riviera Maya, but we weren't warned in advance and the hotel wasn't appropriately responsive to some of my friends (i.e. a pregnant woman) who couldn't handle the noise and needed to change rooms.

Tablet Plus benefits were not honored."

"132147","61328","1","Don't stay at hotel, you can get better deals and rooms in NYC.  The hotel also lied they said internet is included but you can only get it in the lobby and you will have to pay $15 a day per device.  I think it's a rip off most hotels will allow you to use 3 devices when you pay. "

"132161","61334","1","Book your in house restaurant reservations ahead of your stay for the best time periods, we found them limited by the time we arrived and were there for a week. "
"132170","61338","1","If tired and hungry in the evening, the restaurant was more than we could have asked for. Service was charming, food perfect and local dark beer a fine way to participate in local culture."
"132175","61340","1","Expect smaller spaces in Paris in general. This one's rooms are on smaller side but is at a more affordable rate. There was construction/scaffolding on facade so I stayed in an interior room."
"132192","61348","1","Not much entertainment for children, so bring plenty of toys. Ask to use the hotel staff for babysitting instead of a outside service. Get the cucumber martini - it's amazing. If your bags don't make it on your Winair flight - don't panic, it's often times left behind in St. Maarten due to weight restrictions. The airport staff will not tell you this. "

Take advantage of the day trips, especially to Tanquile Island  We spent 3 nights at the hotel and thought that was the right amount of time. If you head to or from Cusco we highly suggest the Andean Explorer train."

Try to book a tablet rate that includes breakfast as there is nothing else in the immediate hotel area other than other hotel restaurants and a terrible cafe in the building. If you are allergic to scents be warned they pump strong scents in the hallways."

"132680","61562","1","Street facing rooms can be noisy but not a problem if you realise you are smack in the middle of some of the coolest joints in SG and partake fully - embrace the vibe ! Porch rooms with private outdoor space worth the extra if sound control important. "

"132698","61570","1","Very old fashion style"
"132703","61572","1","ask about the history of the hotel. The one front of house woman gave us a print out of old ghost stories and even offered a tour. The pool is great, and so is the restaurant. It is walking distance to many of La Jollas best attractions and restaurants. Worth requesting a room with Ocean view... you can hear the waves crashing, such a treat."
"132706","61573","1","Try the bar upstairs. If coming by train, the hotel is actually one level up once entering the shopping mall. Directly connected to the mall so convenient, but I don't think there are signs that tell you it's above one level so might be confusing."

"132770","61600","1","The room I was in, 215, had a strong chlorine odor. Also- there are NO parking options other than the hotel, so expect to be charged $40.00 more per day above room rate. The walls are exceptionally thin between rooms."
"132787","61608","0","After reading reviews of the London, we requested a two room suite with a preference for a high level room with views to Central Park.  We got the high level room which was great, but apparently no two room suites face Central Park.  This was disappointing.  "
"132792","61610","1","Do the yoga lessons. The spa is great. Going around and visiting other places in Bali takes a lot of time... Traffic is really bad on the island, so take your time. The cars with drivers from the hotel were really good value and helpful. "
"132799","61613","1","If you like to sleep in a temperature cooler than 24 degrees Centigrade, then make this clear to the hotel when you book, and again when you check in, and ask for one of the rooms where temperature can be lowered."

"132947","61678","1","MUST try the cinnamon roll in the café. It's the best one I've ever had. "
"132956","61682","1","There are better properties in the same plaza.  The INKATERRA group has a lovely, secluded guest house just across from the Monasterio.  The rooms, service, food and overall vibe are sublime and far exceed anything the Monasterio offers. Very private---like your own home with beautiful touches. everywhere."
"132959","61683","1","Go, spend time and surrender to the land and culture of the Sacred Valley. The environmental programs they run here are outstanding and must be supported.  Orchid farming, bear protection, etc. ALL should be experienced by visitors to understand how remarkable and visionary INKATERRA is.  If the land and the animals and plants are destroyed, no more Sacred Valley.  INKATERRA gets this and seduces you into becoming more enlightened. A very light hand here leads down the path of serious eco-tourism."

"132965","61685","1","noisy  and very poor service "
"132992","61698","1","Great placement, pricing & service. If possible book a queen sized room. For your stay"
"132995","61699","1","pay the extra for the north/mountain facing rooms.  we thought the additional charge was about the view but it's really about the noise.  also, turn on the fan/AC as it helps drown out the buses and cars.  "
"132998","61700","1","Go over details of special offer at check-in to avoid missing out."
"133008","61705","1","Ok if you've got money to burn and aren't looking to spend much time at the actual hotel. Not really a destination spot."
"133033","61717","1","May have been there on off nights, but the bar restaurant weren't as lively as I would have thought for BB.  Brunch is very good, should try it once."

"133064","61731","1","King bed is two twin beds pushed together.  It's more charming than it sounds."
"133067","61732","0","The double room is small, but I guess usual for Paris. There isn't a hotel bar of sorts, more restaurant vibe, but there are a couple local bars just down the road which are lovely."
"133074","61735","1","For a quieter room, ask for one in the back."
"133085","61740","1","complimentary valet parking. Great nightlife scene."
"133090","61742","1","We loved our room 318. It's at the very end of the property and is quiet, spacious, and has a lovely patio and sitting area. The rooms in Building 1 have the best chance of ocean view, but are adjacent to the pool area, so may be noisy.  Also, the hotel sits on a bay and the waves are pretty minimal, so don't expect surfing conducive waves.  We read that pool chairs are scare and rented a cabana our first day, but it was totally unnecessary -- there were tons of chairs available, as there are poolside chairs, beach chairs, and chairs on the hill sloping away from the pool."
"133099","61746","1","The bathroom pod is translucent - so best stay with someone who you are VERY comfortable with.  "
"133102","61747","1","Go for a late night cocktail in the Zetter Townhouse. The Coffee in Workshop Coffee opposite is great. Also have a quick look around the museum of St John which is just across St John's Sq. It's really quite interesting."
"133109","61750","1","Make sure you get a King room. The Queen is very small. "
"133118","61754","1","Best place for long weekends in Rome!"
"133125","61757","1","Book this hotel.  It is the relaxing vibe away from the standard loud and crowded Waikiki.  The staff and hotel is beyond 5 stars."
"133136","61762","0","Superior rooms a MUST!!"
"133143","61765","1","ask for courtyard room"
"133150","61768","1","Ask for a King Corner, all other rooms are small & small designed. The tub takes all day to fill, be advised of the waste of water this entails."
"133153","61769","1","Not for people who have trouble with stairs. Lots of them and no elevator. Get a Thai massage with yoga stretches at the spa--fabulous."
"133156","61770","1","Hotel is located in an area where you need a car or taxi to do anything.  There is a bar/casual restaurant, but there are no amenities at the hotel (i.e. pool), so you have to leave the property every day.  They are across the street from beach access and have a towel guy at the beach, which is nice."
"133169","61776","1","Top floor rooms with terraces are amazing"
"133172","61777","1","Restaurant PLA is absolutely delicious and tucked away.  Romantic."

"133192","61785","1","Free bottles of water, Nespresso machine in room and delicious nightly turn down treats like cookies and macaroons!"
"133201","61789","1","ASk for a room with both a tub and shower not just a shower."
"133214","61795","1","There are a few bars nearby and you can be woken by revelers emerging in the early hours. Also - not really a good place for business travel if you need to get any work done in your room"
"133217","61796","1","Great for 2-4 nights - might get a little bored if stayed for longer"
"133226","61800","1","Great spot, friendly receptionists who were really helpful."
"133231","61802","1","Clarify what's included in the 'free' breakfast when you check in, and ask staff about the honour bar before you dive in. "
"133238","61805","1","Location, though quite central, is not obvious to find if using a traditional map rather than GPS. "

"133281","61825","1","Verona is such a charming city"
"133288","61828","1","Ask for an upper floor."
"133295","61831","1","No where that I could find on the Tablet description of the hotel was there any mention of the $26 ""administration fee"" I was saddled with when I checked out. When I asked what this was for, I was told it was for the complimentary wine at happy hour (which I was never told about); internet access (for which the desk clerk told me there was no password needed, implying to me that there was no charge for using it); and the gym (which I did not use). Perhaps I am naive or old fashioned in thinking that these things should be factored into the price of the room quoted. This type of deceptive practice is exactly why Richard Branson is starting his chain of Virgin Hotels in the US."
"133318","61842","1","The room (# 4) that we stayed in is the smallest, but even though it is small it's so well designed to use all available space and to be comfy that we didn't mind it at all.   LOVED the modern, well-appointed bathroom with huge rain shower, large sink, plenty of shelves to keep things, etc."
"133327","61846","1","I preferred breakfast outside the hotel. "
"133340","61852","1","* unless you are traveling really light, and I mean really light, avoid the small rooms (13sqm and 15 sqm rooms), you will not be able to store much.

* The hotel does not have a full service restaurant nor a spa, so be prepared to eat outside.  Not a problem in my case, as there are some good restaurants around the hotel. "
"133343","61853","1","Make a weekend of it.  Enjoy being in Soho and shop.  The hotel is more like a home than a typical hotel."
"133350","61856","1","great food in both restaurants, good design,
location is a weaker point - if you are to explore London it's far away from the attractions, if you're on business it is well commuted with the city, otherwise it is also far"
"133359","61860","1","Claro!!!"
"133362","61861","1","I stayed on four and on some mornings could hear some street noise. I am from a big city, so it was not an issue for me, but might be for the noise sensitive. All in all, though, it was quiet. "
"133371","61865","1","Use the concierge. He was great with recommendations. The area is fantastic. Lots of local restaurants and boutiques. "
"133374","61866","1","Don't stay here, it's not worth it.
"
"133377","61867","1","Always book in advance for the Rumpus room or the Spa "
"133396","61876","1","The room was nice, not worth the price.
No tub, small bathroom. Historical building so ceilings were low in spots."
"133399","61877","1","Ask for rooms away from the street for a quainter experience."
"133402","61878","1","Try to stay on the highest floor to avoid being woken up by party people walking around in heels at midnight. 

Parking was super easy! Save on valet and spend the few bucks to park across the street. Just make sure to get out there before 9am. "
"133405","61879","1","At least have a drink at the restaurant.
Enjoy the Spa, which is very nice."
"133408","61880","1","This is one of the overall nicest hotels we have ever had the pleasure to stay.  Everything is top notch.  Do not miss the spa!"
"133417","61884","1","Le spa n'est pas immense donc essayez d'y aller aux heures creuses !"
"133420","61885","1","The restaurant is great,  as are the communal areas"
"133425","61887","1","Even though the buffet sounds amazing make sure not to miss the seated restaurant.  Food is amazing and it will probably save you a few dollars.  Make sure to make your reservations early as it fills up quickly"
"133428","61888","1","This is not a hotel for anyone looking for a quiet and/or peaceful oasis during their stay in San Diego. It seemed to be a place for people to party more than anything. If you can, upgrade to a surf pad with a view of the ocean - one of the corner rooms if possible. The rooms near the tower deck open up to a patio for use by all of the guests and you will hear music and/or people talking all day and night."
"133431","61889","1","May be better hotel available at same, or lesser price."
"133434","61890","1","It's in a nice, quiet location, but far from the town center, so you have to drive everywhere. Also, the hotel is expanding, so there are construction trucks and a bit of a mess out back but it didn't bother us. We were still able to get a nice view of the rocks despite the construction."
"133437","61891","1","Definitely book the Guittierez family farm mountain tour.  It was beautifully rich yet simple experience and the food was delicious. "

"133456","61899","1","Great location friendly and attentive service, not intrusive and once the weather gets better ( was there in Feb.) the outdoor spaces should be lovely."
"133459","61900","1","Consult with the hotel on as many things as you can - reservations, cut the line tickets, airport transportation, etc. They are very responsive and want to ensure that your stay is exceptional."
"133482","61911","1","This is a great hotel... ask for a drink voucher for the rood top bar when checking in...."

"133494","61916","1","dont tell anyone about this hotel "

"133519","61927","0","carino"
"133524","61929","1","While this hotel is slightly further away from the shopping/dining district of Waikiki, it is by far the coolest and most relaxed hotel by far in the area. Great service and a very chic little hotel indeed."
"133527","61930","1","If you are desperate to go to the North Shore, stay at this resort for no more than 2 nights - and don't expect to get much for your money.  Be sure to bring lots of extra cash with you because you'll be shelling it out at every turn. To save money, you might want to pop into the Foodland down the road and grab some sushi - it'll save you about $120 on an evening meal..."

We were kept awake most of the night due to excessive noise from both adjacent services.  There is NO HVAC control in the rooms.  The bed was definitely not a queen size (as advertised), was low and wobbly.  After making these complaints to the front desk, we were told that this room is the ""loudest"" and typically they don't book it unless the entire hotel is full.  We would have appreciated this information upon checking in."

Also, the main staff really mostly speaks only spanish--they try hard and are very friendly, but if you have issues or concerns, you'll need to seek out the managers.

Last, the hot water was definitely spotty.  I ended up not really caring--a cool rinse at the end of the hot day was kind of nice, and it added to the overall rustic feel of the hotel, but if a reliable hot shower if part of your ideal vacation, another location may be better."

Eventually we had to offer an absurd amount of money before one agreed to take us. 
Also, performers and artists often drop in at the restaurants to share their art with patrons, and while this might be considered bothersome in a place like New York, we noticed that the locals were very respectful towards the artists, and even if they did not purchase their poems, artwork, or music, they took the time to listen. Be prepared to offer some change, or at the very least, your attention. "

"136601","63246","1","Nice location"
"136604","63247","1","The rooms are quite stuffy so you need a room with an air conditioner (and the air conditioners are rather noisy)."
"136607","63248","1","Get one of the duplexes with a patio. The private parking is great but the sales can be tight so don't bring a giant SUV. L.A. starts later than some other cities but if you're looking for great coffee, check out The Commissary on Fairfax (few blocks away) which is open at 7am (rare in L.A.). Another great benefit of The Charlie is you are near (not walking-near though) the famous Farmer's Market on Fairfax - for the foodies you need 1) pancakes from DuPar's 2) glazed doughnuts from Bob's 3) Nutella crepes from The French Crepe Co. - it doesn't get more vintage L.A. than the Farmer's Market.

Hotel about to start floor by floor renovations."
"136801","63330","1","13m2 is a very small room for two people.  It would probably have been ok for one person, but we were two staying for 3 nights - with luggage for 4 days in Paris.  "

"136818","63336","1","I won't be staying at this hotel again and it isn't really of the sort of quality I would expect from Tablethotels. "

"136843","63348","1","Stay here! It's amazing!"
"136846","63349","1","This place is amazing. If I had to have one note of constructive criticism, it would be that our room (#1) was a little close to the highway and was a little loud at times. Try and get a room at the back of the property and you are set."

"136869","63359","0","Make sure you use the excellent spa on the 45th floor as well as the infamous pool"
"136890","63369","1","This remodeled hotel has a pleasant, fun atmosphere, but the quality of the building is not up to par with its style. Doors & walls are on the thin side. So if you are a light sleeper you may want to consider this"

"137489","63623","1","There's a complimentary breakfast provided by the attached restaurant, Dirty French, I recommend not taking advantage. In the mornings the staffing is sparse and you have to wait forever to get served. This isn't the hotel's fault because it's separately run, but We recommend to take advantage of the array of great restaurants for breakfast elsewhere."

"137645","63689","1","Well there is definitely a lot of construction in the area, so just keep that in mind if you're looking for something more peaceful or scenic. I had a few meals and drinks on the patio and it was lovely, but the view wasn't the best and the construction noises were kind of annoying. But inside it was never an issue, and I'm sure that once that construction ends, the area will be amazing. "

It's about 25mins and if you're good with directions relatively easy. It's near a taxi rank area so you you can get to other places if need be 

I walked back to the hotel in the evening at night and it felt very safe too. No one really bothers you and it's generally quite relaxed. "

"137730","63724","1","Make sure to rent a scooter and visit the island. You will realize that The Hansaar is well located, private beaches are rare and although it's right next to the Fisherman's village which is quite touristy, it doesn't have the depraved aspect of other areas on the island. The landscapes are beautiful and very different all around the island and if you are looking for local food we strongly recommend the main food markets on the island."

"137774","63744","1","The sound from the nightclub can be heard as low as the 7th floor as late as 4am. The bed literally vibrates! Also don't expect any special treatment as a guest, you're treated the very same as the general public with regards to the restaurants, bars and club on site."
"137777","63745","1","José Andres' Bazaar in the nearby SLS serves an interesting take on tapas. Local House has great simple dishes. The Wolfsonian Museum is not to be missed.Neither are the incredible street art at Wynwood Walls in the Arts District. "

"137799","63755","1","Regular rooms on lower floors very dark & face a brick wall & that was an upgrade.
This room was a bit worn and the carpet needs replacing.
When I  said that didn't work for me they
did upgrade me to a suite on a higher floor with a street view so at least the room was bright and in better shape than the first option.
The Blue Ribbon Sushi Restaurant is excellent.

If walking from the main intersection, follow the wall with the built-in hedges, halfway down the block, past the bus shelter about 20 meters.  It seems like you won't find a door, but there will be a driveway and guard shack to signify the entrance.  Good luck with the taxi drivers, too."

If you're going to stay here you will be taking taxis (very affordable) or buses to other parts of the city. For the adventurous and physically fit, like us, you can walk the 245 steps down to the area near the river and walk or catch the subway from there. This is not a good choice of hotel for someone who wants to stay closer to the city center, but an excellent choice for those who want to be just a bit away from the craziness.

It's a great area with lots of fantastic places to eat and stroll.

The hotel is quite 'lived in'. Not in a bad way. It's part of its charm. But if you're a perfectionist it might not be for you.

"138540","64059","1","We had a nice dinner on Sunday evening. The restaurant was quiet, indeed we were the only table, and the food was sophisticated but not too complicated.   "
"138551","64064","1","Just enjoy"

"138692","64124","1","Great location in Greenwich Village. Walk around during the day, hotel bar is fun and cool at night. Rooms were very comfortable and spacious (a luxury in NYC). Room service was delicious and timely (try the veggie flatbread)."
"138705","64130","1","The front of the hotel is quite grand, however most of the rooms are in the back which is a 70's block. Sound proofing not great."

"138791","64167","1","Almond Bar on the corner has the best middle eastern food and a great vibe.  Rooftop bar at Darlo across the road great for balmy nights."

"138838","64187","1","Know that the neighborhood is in more of a financial district and not in the middle of the historic center.  It's a little bit of a sterile area but easily accessible to the center via the subway system."

In this case, do not do anything: Hans will take out the chairs while you are out driving around in Andalusia without even telling you so that you can sleep well."
"138864","64197","1","Definitely ask about your Tablet perks, they told us they are not aware of what we were promised. In the end we did get an upgrade, but only after they tried to put us in a twin bed room facing a brick wall. We were on our honeymoon so we requested the upgrade. "

"138927","64226","1","Go ahead and book it … the price is fair for what you get."
"138930","64227","1","Uber not working great yet in Istanbul.  Traffic can consume your trip if you're not careful which makes public transportation a wise option."

"138936","64229","1","Luxe suite is amazing!  Take out the hotel bikes to Stanley Park, Granville, etc."
"138953","64237","1","location is random but it's worth it if you get the great hotel and price "
"138960","64240","1","good budget option, but guests should not expect four-star service or amenities. our room, while spacious and well-laid-out, felt like a hostel."
"138965","64242","1","Book the rooms on the higher floors overlooking the garden. "
"138972","64245","1","Perhaps bring your own coffee maker. (I often travel with an electric espresso pot but I didn't think I would have to do that in New Orleans.)"

Donc, hôtel à éviter si vous voulez profiter au quotidien des charmes de Séville.
Sinon, une étape merveilleuse (malgré quelques améliorations à apporter) sur les routes d'Andalousie. Vous pourrez profiter d'une petite ville de rêve pour vous quasi seuls !"

"139325","64393","1","The feeling is very much of staying in an apartment hotel more than in a ""traditional"" style hotel. Common areas are de facto not existing (the reception is part of the bar). 
The ground floor of the building were the hotel is located hosts a renown fitness centre."

"139396","64423","1","Do not stay in room 27 1/2.  It is really not a room at all.  Also, if offered room 6, it is the room next to the bar. Even a staff member stated they would never stay in that room!
There is no real food offered.  We even had to eat breakfast outside the hotel.  The Cookshop across the street was a welcome site.
And $9 for 2 cups of coffee at the coffe bar...it was not that special.  "

"139409","64428","1","If you are arriving on a Fri-Sun., there will be many Chinese mainlanders, especially at the ferry terminal, lined up for the free casino shuttle buses. Do yourself a favor and book a limo in advance. It is a short drive, but it would be a long wait for a bus or a taxi. The rest of the week the buses are very nice and running continuously."

"139604","64509","1","In comparison to other hotels we've stayed at, the rooms here are a little uncomfortable - small and sort of Basic.  If quiet is important to you, this neighbourhood is very loud at all hours of the night.  If you are ok with the noise and a room that isnt luxurious at all, then the rates are great for where this hotel is located."

"139666","64535","1","This hotel is not in a particularly good part of town.  Also the front door spills right out onto a bus stop, so you enter and exit through a group of people who want to wait inside the hotel and therefor you need a special key to enter the building and you need to make sure you shut the door right away.  My room on the 5th floor was beautiful.  It had a large claw foot bathtub and loads of yummy bath products.  I would recommend this floor!"

Things did not work in the room a/c, a sink that leaked all over the floor, the blinds did not work and the hotel management was not willing to take responsibility.

"140047","64697","1","Don't be scared off by the fact that the hotel is not in Positano.  The shuttle is very easy and efficient and it's 10 mins (but feels like 5) into town.  

They have essential oils heating in a little rock in the rooms which gives off a strong (but nice) smell.  If you are averse/ allergic to fragrance you can unplug it or should request that they do so before your arrival. "

You might notice that most of the marketing materials and images of the hotel include a statue of a strange character.  This lifesize statue is of a fictional ""Prince Andaz"" who puts dreams into your head.  The cupped hands around his mouth look like he's about to chomp into a big hamburger (the Burger King style crown helps this image), rather than impart dreems to the guests.

"141147","65167","1","Don't expect a fancy room - or a room that is reflective of the lobby. Rooms are super simple and actually somewhat design void. I thought there could have been a little more going on in the rooms, but I also appreciated the extra space and simplicity."
"141156","65171","1","Explore the local area and Granger & Co have just opened a cafe behind the hotel."
"141159","65172","1","Beware that Murano is a long way from the main island of Venice.

This hotel is geared for large package groups of tourists and is not what I would consider to be a Tablet Hotel."
"141162","65173","1","Walk around the local area."
"141165","65174","1","If they allow you to upgrade for a small fee, I would highly recommend it. The executive rooms are huge and give great views over London"

"141242","65207","1","think twice before making a reservation"
"141253","65212","1","Não alugue carro . O local é de ruim acesso para veículos , devido às ruas estreitas e não vale a pena . Melhor andar de táxi ou metrô .
Dica importante: não confie nos taxistas, principalmente quando pega o táxi nos pontos turísticos. Oferecem preço fechado e geral o dobro do taxímetro . Alguns chegam a desligar i taxímetro assim que chega ao destino para você não ver o preço e então aumentas até 30% o valor final . Todas as corridas giram entorno de 10 euros , interessante, mas acontece.!No mais aproveitem , tudo ótimo."
"141256","65213","1","The rooms are very small, which is typical for NYC hotels, so just something to know to expect ahead of time. "
"141263","65216","1","Restaurants close around 8/9 pm in Tokyo. Eat where the Japanese do - it's very good food. V. cheap too. Ask for English menu but best to choose from plastic window displays. Honestly! Avoid 'Italian' restaurants - they over charge for wine. Sake and beer costs the same as soft drinks - about £3.50 for half litre."
"141266","65217","1","We didn't have breakfast included but paid 3000 yen each for the privilege. Read elsewhere people thought it 'extortionate'. IT ISN'T. It's a five course meal (at least) and worth every single yen.
If you're doing multi centre tour, use Ta-Q-Bin for moving your suitcases - v. reasonable cost. Hotel takes care of it for you but needs 24 hours warning. "
"141269","65218","1","The rooms are very quaint, but very small.  I was in there by myself and can't imagine having someone sharing that space with me.  The showers are a bit ""unique"".  Only a half sheet of glass.  No shower curtain or door.  Water gets everywhere."

"141468","65300","1","I was upgraded to a suite that faced the street and had a small balcony - great, except for the noise factor. The non-suite rooms do not have outside windows - just a door with half windows facing onto a courtyard and corridor.
Rooms are very dark - packing is a challenge, and so is reading.
Location is a couple of blocks from the Zocalo, and therefore highly touristy. 
"
"141471","65301","1","If you are a business traveler try using Beijings taxi app, called DD, to get a luxury car. Many of the taxis are small, with no a/c and no access to change your window height, as many cars simply are in ill repair. You are going to spend a lot of time in traffic and it is worth the effort. If You are not traveling with a native Mandarin speaker then use the hotel car services. "
"141474","65302","1","I loved the old world style of the place"
"141479","65304","1","Since the lobby is basically an office, if you have a late flight it is best to plan ahead so you have a place to wait after checkout...there are no real public areas of the hotel where you can easily wait until you have to leave. "
"141488","65308","1","This hotel is a hot spot on weekends with the pool scene. Great fun ! Can be loud. If that's what you want you will love it."

"141515","65319","1","Please do realize that the rooms are quite small and that in the summer can be quite warm as no air conditioning is available. Location is great and would recommend the hotel to others keeping in mind points stated above. The breakfast available is relatively basic for the price and with plenty of options around one can easily skip booking with it."
"141532","65327","1","Rooms are smaller than some, but still amazingly laid out. Ask for an upgrade if space is a concern. Even room facing parking lot was phenomenally quiet. "
"141535","65328","1","Only go if you're prepared for noise. "
"141540","65330","1","sea view rooms are the best bet. "
"141543","65331","1","Very pleasant hotel with a very attentive staff. But the dinners (2) were disappointing & expensive for Portugal. Stay here by all means, but dine somewhere else."
"141552","65335","1","If your going to stay here, I suggest using Uber and the bus. Parking is crazy, scarce and expensive everywhere in Miami. Uber can take you anywhere the bus doesn't and is there within minutes. The bus takes you right to Ocean Drive, Lincoln Mall, Collins Ave, etc. Just ask a local to point you to the bus stop. And the beach is literally across the street. "
"141557","65337","1","If booking with kids, request a room far away from music. It's great for people who don't have bedtimes, though!"
"141560","65338","1","Definitely a compact hotel. Don't bring large luggage. "
"141565","65340","1","From Narita airport, I took the Skyliner train to Keisei Ueno station then take a taxi to the hotel (about 10 minute ride, 1,200 yen). It was pleasant and quick.  For me this is much easier than taking the Access Express train which may or may not require a transfer (depending on the route) and you may have to struggle with your suitcases up and down the stairs of Asakusa station [which does have an elevator, but it's not particularly easy to find.]"
"141568","65341","1","Ask for a your away from or near the noisy courtyard as you wish."

"141635","65370","1","Service is light so its helpful to already have restaurant tips"
"141638","65371","1","If this hotel is around $100, go for it.  If it is around $150 (or above, like we paid), you'll be happier with paying for something better"
"141643","65373","1","They have a pretty impressive selection of 24 hour snacks and drinks, just in case you are arriving late."
"141648","65375","1","Base your Chicago vacations from here!"
"141657","65379","1","Try to get a room with a balcony on the higher floor. They are quite special!"
"141660","65380","1","nice place to relax from central Tokyo for one or two  days, exploring the neighbourhood - not suited for longer stays and when you plan  to explore other parts of town"
"141663","65381","1","Ne pas prendre une chambre au rez de chaussée comme la G24 par exemple qui se trouve sur le passage de clients bruyants et des chariots de petits déjeuner à partir de 7h30. Donc pas de grasse matinée possible"
"141670","65384","1","The positives far out-way the small room.  We had the entry level room price, which is not inexpensive. One could book larger rooms. Will definitely stay here again the next time we are in London."

"141701","65397","1","Book here if you're familiar with Istanbul or if you don't plan to do much sightseeing / if your itinerary is more scoping out the surrounding neighborhood. Also, might be worth splurging on a nicer room as our standard room was very bare-bones. "

If you're paying the last minute $230 price than it's not a bad option if you're looking for a nice affordable place to stay. It is mostly modern and chic...just the rooms aren't the best but the bed is comfortable"

"141882","65473","1","If you are young and fun and want to be close to everything, this is perfect for you! The Ocean's Ten bar is right next door, and it is kind of loud with music and lights, so if you go to bed before 2am, this might disturb you. However, if you'll be out that late anyway, this place is perfect!"
"141889","65476","1","Awesome for couples but the beds& rooms may feel too intimate to share with someone if you're not a couple. Lots of bars, clubs and restaurants in walking distance.

Dinner at The Duck & Rice gastro pub ; delicious Chinese food a few minutes walk from the hotel.

As well as to arrange any spa-type service that you would like. They were incredibly helpful with great tips & recommendations, but we didn't think to start that conversation prior to our arrival, which left us with fewer options because they needed more advance notice to make arrangements.  In short, take advantage of their wonderful hospitality in advance of your arrival."

The shower stall is also small and it is necessary to place shampoo and body gel containers on the floor or outside the shower as there is no place in the shower stall to put them.

It was not stated anywhere that the hotel would be under serious construction when I booked my room.  The hotel has potential, but I would definitely not recommend staying here until all the construction is complete.

"142346","65673","1","Try to stay on the non Wilshire side. Although the room was fairly quiet, there was some street noise. "

"142372","65684","1","Make use of the concierges, they helped me with so many things. Getting directions, bookings for things. I had contacted them before my arrival with a few questions and got a prompt and helpful reply in each case.  Alex and Antoine were wonderful, persisted in trying to get a booking for Ledoyen, which was booked out, but they eventually succeeded in securing a table. It was well worth it. They made many good suggestions for places to try. "

"142498","65736","1","Do yourself a favor and visit The Datai. Any room or villa will offer you pure tranquility and enjoyment. Make sure to eat at the Gulai House for dinner. It was my favorite. Also make sure to take a nature walk with the resident conservationist, Arshad. He is great!"
"142505","65739","1","Don't stay in rooms that face Gravier street as it gets very noisy from the bars outside. Ask for rooms in the back."
"142510","65741","1","Go here if you want a great/central location.  The rooms are clean, but tight, and there aren't any public lounge areas, so it really is just a place to sleep, not to relax and be pampered."
"142513","65742","1","Unless you can get a suite or nicer room, I would avoid this hotel. There are more places off the beaten path with a better proximity to the train as well as other activities or destinations. I found anything I wanted to do, including walking around for cool shops or delicious food, was about a ten minute taxi ride."
"142520","65745","1","Do not miss The Nickel. Fantastic happy hour!"
"142541","65755","1","for a fraction of a price, you have much more space and comfort than hip downtown hotels.  this hotel is still very hip!  yet  only 2 stops away from the city.  plus, subway station is one minute walk away!"

"142586","65774","1","Be aware that you are in one of the busiest and touristic parts of Vienna but once inside your room you wouldn't know. Car parking is away from the hotel. Once there you wouldn't need it as the hotel is so central."
"142589","65775","0","Do not stay here if you don't like noise. This place is VERY loud. It's also for a much younger population. My BF and I are in our late 30s and felt quite ""old"" for this scene. There is a club in the hotel that plays music till 2am. We didn't mind it, but I can certainly see how in a few more years we would. You did get asked to see your hotel room key when you enter the hotel during ""club"" hours, which really made us feel...I don't know...like ""clubbers"" and not guests of a hotel. "
"142598","65779","1","Excellent spa - the Rainforest treatment is unique and well worth doing.  We had 3 spa treatments each in 5 days - every one better than the last. A phenomenal guide for a day out to Ek Balam (Mayan ruins) arranged by the hotel.  When I go back (which I will..) I am going to have a 60 minute foot massage at least every other day - probably the best deal in the place and more than just a foot massage.  Oh, and the daily Mexican breakfast buffet is terrific, but probably too big to eat every day."

"142730","65834","0","Decide if you'd like to request a city view or ocean view room. Both fews are great but it depends on your preference. Also, you can check out a portable wifi hotspot for just 5 Euros a day which is helpful. There is also a Michelin rate restaurant at the top of the hotel but you'll need to make reservations pretty far in advance."
"142743","65840","1","Quem for alérgico a perfumes não deve se hospedar pois ele jogam a fragrância no ar condicionado para perfumar todos os ambientes inclusive os quartos. O perfume constante é péssimo para quem tem rinite e outras alergias ex., enxaqueca"

"142769","65851","1","good for a day or two if you would like to be in a remote location."
"142786","65859","1","It's worth arranging for the hotel to pick you up from the airport at least on arrival. I'm not sure we would have found the place the first day without being led there. But once you've gone there it's easy to find your way back and you have a great reference point (parking Riad Larousse) to give to taxi drivers the rest of your stay. "
"142799","65865","1","La Terraza room is a bit of a walk up, but completely worth it. "

"142872","65894","1","Avoid rooms from the street as it will be noisy at 6 am. Avoid rooms with ending 07 08 and 09. they are in front of cupboard cabinets and the cleaning stuff makes a racket in the morning. It is quite upsetting. Also the rooms have bad acoustic so if somebody class above you, you feel like she/he is vacuuming inside your head."

"
"143278","66063","1","Location - be aware that a bit tricky to find the Riad. Download offline maps to help you out. if you get super lost pay a local kid to take you to the door (5-10 MAD). 

Food - some great restaurants open in marrakech. expect to pay just under what you would at home (not amazing cheap eats), but gorgeous settings and yum food.

Get out of town - loved the seaside city of Essaouria! Also do the day trips to the Atlas mountains. stunning and nice to get out of the hustle and bustle of the marrakech Medina.

"143337","66087","1","On a map, the location looks pretty close to everything but it is a bit of a walk. Keep in mind you'll be walking a good 15 minutes every day to get to the central shopping/restaurants and harbor. There isn't much around the hotel and is on a main loud street. Should you have issues with street noise, I would recommend staying in a higher room. "

As it happened, the location proved perfect for my visit. It turned out to be situated in the hipster area of Karakoy and the port for ferries across the Asian side was just minutes away. It's also easy distance to the Old City. The staff were all very friendly and spoke good English. I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Istanbul"

On arrival, we were told that we had been 'upgraded' to a ""castle view suite"" because they had given our requested and confirmed suite (the Fresco suite) to someone else. There was no castle view from the suite we were given, but we were very pleased with it anyway. The hotel is lovely, the service is thoughtful (otherwise) and we were very comfortable in our large and well-appointed suite. Fabulous place!"

"143668","66229","1","We did not see all the rooms, but some of them are spectacular, ask if you can see them before you book or occupy if possible. You will not get a real impression of the hotel at first but once you walk in it is spectacular. The breakfast was superb."

The airstream trailer room is REALLY tiny and has only a bath (no shower), but it is cute."

"143875","66318","1","This hotel is not in a convenient location. Yes, it is only a 15 min walk to a subway - but, you will always have to switch stations. We ended up taking a cab to the other station that goes into the main city. It's a quiet area, so if you want to walk to a lot of cafes and bars then you will need to walk about 30 min. It's not the kind of hotel that you will just come back to for a shower or rest. It is stylish, but not sure the location is really worth it. The restaurant serves mostly American food. "

"144091","66408","1","All of the rooms are different; our first night we were in a room with a steep ladder up to the sleeping area that just did not work for us; we were moved the next day to a great room all on one level. Also the hotel is perched on a cliff above one of the best beaches in Mykonos where there are three beach clubs; music from the beach clubs wafts up the cliff and can be distracting and annoying to say the least; it is not constant but visitors should be aware of this."

We had dinner and discovered a superb dining

"144218","66463","1","the only issue we had was with the wifi and the people at the front office very quickly helped us out to fix the problem"
"144221","66464","1","Rooms in the front, facing the park, enjoy a beautiful view, but there's a bit of traffic noise from the street, which is fairly busy. It didn't bother me...but those who are sensitive might want to ask for an interior-facing room."
"144228","66467","1","The small rooms really are small. This is Venice, so it's par for the course, but worth keeping in mind. "

Take advantage of the sauna and steam room! (I didn't know about them until a couple days in when I flipped through the Survivor's Guide.) "
"144504","66581","1","Don't get confused when you walk into the sharp tiny lobby, you don't check in there - walk into the courtyard and check in at The Barn. Parking is pretty tight in the front lot so arrive early and take an Uber into town so you don't loose your spot. The charm is rustic not luxurious, so you don't get total blackout in your rooms from the early morning sunrise - bring a sleeping mask if light bothers you."

"144549","66600","1","Not the best destination if you have kids. But if you enjoy great food, great atmosphere, excellent drinks and people watching, this is the place. Very central and surrounded by pubs, restaurants and cool boutiques. Vibrant and exciting. "
"144552","66601","1","Book a bespoke tour and a driver if you can afford it. Makes the whole site seeing experience a lot less hot, dusty, expedited and very pleasant. Athens is a very nice city with very kind people that will go out of their way to accommodate you. "
"144555","66602","1","My only regret is that i did not book a suite with a private jacuzzi and a larger patio! it was too late to upgrade as the hotel is booked during the summer months. Aside of that the entire experience is fantastic: great food and great service. No kids in this hotel and that is a good thing - the steps are very steep and the walls quite low so I can see it would be dangerous for children to wander around. "
"144568","66608","1","Stay in for dinner at the hotel during one of the 2 nights that they offer it. (Wednesday or Saturday) Eat at the communal table and interact with the other guests. Since most of them are not first timers, they can also give you good tips about the surrounding area. "

It is a good 3 hours from Perth International Airport (which is currently--i.e. mid 2015--a bit of a mess thanks to expansion works). June/July is a wonderful time to go - there are relatively few tourists because it is ""winter"" (i.e. 18-25 C by day, 5-10 at night)...ideal for outdoor activities."

"144972","66778","1","The bathrooms do not have doors and it was awkward for our modest teenaged daughters."
"144977","66780","1","Since every room is completely different it would warrant a bit of questioning and investigation into what you want exactly. This is especially true of the bathrooms which seem to be all rather cobbled together from existing spaces and plumbing. Ask if you have any special needs."
"144980","66781","1","There's an exstensive activities list that is quite impressive. Don't go for the food. It's fine, but nothing special."
"144983","66782","1","Within walking distance you will find cafes, galleries and shopping - not to mention the Eiffel Tower so be sure to wear your walking shoes.

"145063","66816","1","Do some research before you go on things to do in Gipuzkoa ... the hotel is amazing because it's so secluded, and the sense of seclusion is the principal reason why we chose it, but there are some great things to do in the general area that require a bit of pre-planning, like San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, Etxebarri for an amazing meal, San Sebastian for delicious pinxtos, etc."
"145066","66817","1","Fabulous facility.  Not a great beach.  Nice to look at from a lounger with a drink in hand, but rough/choppy water, murky, debris, and loads of seaweed.  Not a place where you will grab a snorkel and step into the water to explore.  That was disappointing to our kids."

"145090","66826","1","Make sure you call and have a nice room allocated. We were very happy with our room - but were told that our room/cottage was not one of the best and we think this is because we booked through a travel website and not the hotel itself. I have had this happen before. Though we made the most of it and couldn't complain as the room itself was stunning and the staff amazing!!"

Avoid the PUB at 11a Vaci Utca, where the local mafia are grossly overcharging for drinks and food that you may not have even ordered.

"146547","67450","1","Keep in mind that the rooms in this hotel Are rather typically Parisian in size and quirky layout. The Marilyn Monroe theme gets old pretty fast (giant MM silk screens fill the room, MM films playing on a loop in the elevator).  The location is ideal for shopping in the Rue du Commerce area and for easy access to the Champs de Mars etc. It's a reasonably quiet hotel and street, though I was surprised that during the daytime the pop music playing in the hallway could be heard in my room, through two doors; this was turned off at night though.

We had a reservation for 7 nights and were given a room facing ongoing construction, which would run ""only"" from 8:30 to 5 except for Sundays, we were told. When we asked for a change, we were shown a room with a small window a few feet from the adjoining building's wall. We decided to leave altogether, but were assured that the following day we'd been given a quieter room. 
The room we have now is much smaller, and would be fine by London standards, but most certainly not at this price. We are only staying because we don't have time to look for another place and move. Check out the Pelham around the corner: you'll get much more for a little bit more money. "

"148480","68255","1","It is worth to pay the higher price for the suite, especially when sharing the room. The bueger truck outside is a pretty relaxing area and if one feels like playing basketball or soccer, there is a cool place at the end of the park. "

It also has day visitors through its beach club and has frequent special events, making it impossible for hotel guests to enjoy the pool and beach, which are mobbed with non-hotel guests. We were hugely disappointed with the food and bar, as well. "
"148556","68286","1","enjoy the local area, don't just head for the old town of milan."
"148563","68289","1","There is construction going on in the complex.  We received a call from the hotel advising that there would be noise after 8 am.  To be honest, it was not an issue while we were there. Simply enjoy a beautiful place."
"148566","68290","1","Not an issue, but your car will be parked outside the old city walls.  Perfectly safe and the hotel cheerfully brings you by minivan to the hotel!"

The public places of the hotel are amazing but any one can use them even if they are not staying at the hotel.
They have 600+ rooms at this hotel, I am sure some rooms are nice but ours was pretty average, dark and dusty.
The location of the hotel is just perfect :)"

Head to the happening El Born neighborhood just blocks away, fewer tourists, great shops and restaurants."
"148786","68381","1","Covered patio is nice. Continental breakfast is more than enough to start the day. "
"148791","68383","1","Ask Katrin (Manager) for advice.  She's extremely knowledgable and super competent.  
Other staff are completely at a loss and tend not to admit ignorance but instead to give you incorrect answers.  When we asked whether to do the glacier from there or from our next hotel (Ranga) we were told to do it from the Ion.  In fact, Ion is 1 1/2 hrs further away.  

Be aware that there is a huge geothermal plant spewing smoke just behind the hotel.  We actually got used to it and came to appreciate it but upon arrival it was a most unaesthetic shock.  Also, the hotel photograph shows only the modern front of the hotel and not the entire structure.

Go to the Ranga which is just lovely and has a super knowledgable staff. "

Ask the staff for tips on restaurants and tours - they know Paris! 
The Charms and Secrets electric bike tour in the City is a must! 
The Fat Bike Tour to Versailles was such a highlight.

"148896","68426","1","This hotel is convenient, but the rooms are smallish, the overall hotel feels a dated. The interior is a little cheesy "
"148899","68427","1","All of the areas around Casa Claridge are under construction, so it can be a bit noisy and there are alot of workers outside."

"148928","68439","1","Если вы любите море, выбирайте другой отель! Наверное у них самый некрасивый и маленький пляж на Праслине. Ужасные бетонные серые виллы , который портят весь пейзаж. Отвратительное питание."
"148933","68441","1","A full view of the lake from your room is the only way to go. Tablet Plus membership brings a sail on the lake and private use of the fire-lit swimming pool. Who needs anything more? The table on the jetty offers stunning views morning noon and night."
"148938","68443","1","Front rooms very noisy because across the street the casino español holds weddings and parties with live music and dj's. First night they played until 5am. The music is annoying but more so being unable to open the window because lack of privacy.  AC is just symbolic, very hot.  So if decide to stay get a room where windows can be opened without sacrificing privacy and above all DO NOT. Face casino español.   Overall this hotel is probably best for young people, e.g., 20's-youthful 40's, who enjoy 'hipness' over conventional  comfort."

"149040","68486","1","Sir F.K. is nicely located in Charlottenburg, a short walk to public transport (direct train line to Mitte and all tourist sights) and close to restaurants and nice quiet streets. Highly recommended if you want easy access to the main attractions, but without being in the middle of the tourist clap trap.

"149135","68524","1","Try the Hot Lava Shells massage."
"149140","68526","1","No elevator"
"149149","68530","1","The artsy theme is very appealing and has a very international vibe, from the coffee shop off the lobby and the international reading material.  However, the key rod that activates the power in the room is not intuitive.  It wasn't clear to me that the rod power certain lights and not others.  I didn't realize until the morning after I slept with a floor lamp on all night.  I also didn't realize that the remote control for the TV was located in a concealed compartment built into the platform for the bed.  Functionality is not intuitive; instead it's like a scavenger hunt for features that are otherwise ubiquitous in other hotels."

"149209","68556","1","A éviter. C'est le pire hôtel que j'ai réservé avec Tablet"
"149212","68557","1","Splurge for the sea facing view room if its' available.  We stayed in two rooms during our stay both beautiful, but the sea view of the Bosphorus will knock your socks off.  Great hotel for those who value style and location over luxury amenities, note there is no real lobby or place to gather."
"149219","68560","1","It is actually SUPREMELY hard to find unless you are taken. Arrange through the hotel for someone to get you and take you the first time - ESPECIALLY at night."
"149226","68563","1","None"
"149229","68564","1","Make sure you ask about the size of your bed and if there is a tub in your bathroom...a double bed or a standing shower only signifies what can only be described as a single dorm room."
"149236","68567","1","Many reviewers have complained of the warmth in the room . The beds have water repellent mattress covers and if I had realized before the middle of the night that it was creating an unusual degree of warmth, I would have removed it. "
"149241","68569","1","Highly recommend - location is perfect, very beautiful and wonderful decor"
"149248","68572","1","Be prepared - some of the rooms are VERY small - even by European standards. Room decor is fairly basic."
"149253","68574","1","If you really need a specific room configuration, it is worth following up with the hotel directly to confirm this. Since they make no distinction in the booking process between a double or a twin room, there's no way to know what room types are available until you contact them directly."
"149258","68576","1","1. do not sit by the chinese section for breakfast. seats are not comfy
2. ask for hotel staff to explain the concept of hotel - home away from home and what is free or not 
3. lighting in the room is kind of rigid .. only fixed settings."
"149269","68581","1","Consider the environment where this hotel is collocated. Some of its features can be considered ""not at the level"" in other locations but in Chiang Mai context it's a beauty."
"149276","68584","1","If you are looking for a very reasonable room and no real service it's a perfect spot. If you are looking for a more upscale experience including views and pool and cool LA vibe, there are better places nearby. "

"149345","68613","1","Wander a bit from the hotel...21c is in an interesting area but a dozen or so blocks east are some great restaurants. And Bistro 1860 on Mellwood is terrific. Of course if you just want to stay close to home....Proof in the hotel is a great bar and restaurant."
"149350","68615","1","While 80kms outside of Caceres this hotel and village is worth the stop."
"149355","68617","1","Il servizio della reception. Non ci hanno dato nessuna informazione. Non ci hanno indicato i servizi offerti e nemmeno i privilegi previsti da tablet plus.

"149376","68626","1","If you are here to shop, pay a bit more for a hotel closer in, unless you like the schlep back.  Check prices on hotel website before booking (usually cheaper than elsewhere), breakfast away from hotel, will be ultimately cheaper."
"149393","68634","1","Ask for a room far from the elevator.  Too many loud, drunken guests in the wee hours of the morning"

"149414","68643","1","We got a standard queen room and it felt outdated, small, and like a motel. Definitely don't stay if you want a romantic getaway. It was simple but not in a good minimalist/modern way, rooms have no vibe or character and feel cheap. "

"149900","68847","1","It is unclear from description and other reviews, but this is primarily a family-oriented resort. A majority of the guests during our stay were families with children. We did not expect a place like this to have such a large children's center, but aside from that, children were running around unattended at all hours - at the breakfast buffet, on the beach, at the pool, etc. My husband and I went to the lounge for drinks after dinner, and spent the entire time hearing kids screaming and chasing each other around the pool (around midnight-1am). I would not recommend this for other couples looking to enjoy a romantic stay, but for families, this might be ideal."
"149907","68850","1","Fairly basic as far as design and atmosphere go - not much offered in the way of amenities. However, very reasonably priced!"

The Dream Downtown is no different than a Motel 6 in terms of quality.  Make no mistake, this place should be a night club, not a hotel.  Upon arrival, 11PM ish, I was appropriated to a room directly below their booming PHD club (which is awful, btw).  After attempting to sleep for about 30 minutes, I asked to be moved to a quieter room (I was willing to give this place a chance).  They moved me to a room that wreaked of smoke and a broken door.  The beds are makeshift, and just thinking about the cleanliness of it now gives me the creeps.  They even have those pillow top attachments to the bed, hanging on for dear life.  Scratches on the walls.  It was just terrible."

The bathroom is wonderfully large, but you will need to place a towel across the front of the glass counter that holds the sink. While the design of the faucets, sink and soap holder is great to look at, it is completely impractical. No matter what we did, water would run around the sides of the sink toward the front of the counter - hence, the need for the towel in front of the sink. Water also  creates a soapy pond in the soap holder designed into the glass counter, so your best bet is to use one of the washcloths to absorb the pond before it overflows onto the counter.
Additionally, while there is a make-up mirror, the lighting around the mirror is so dim and the lighting in the bathroom is so low that it is very difficult to apply make-up (another guest in the elevator volunteered this comment and I agree!) and see what it looks like. Given that some guests walk around NYC during the day and not solely at night, it would be marvelous to provide better light in at least the bathroom!"

"150574","69129","1","By all means, take advantage of the breakfasts offered.  Not only is there a huge variety offered, but the vistas across the Bosphoros make the mornings unforgettable, and are some of the best in Istanbul.  Wander the streets nearby, and make sure you grab a lumpur from one of the many food stalls.  Have a little of everything added as a mix in.  Make sure you visit the Neo-Baroque Ortakoy mosque is not to be missed.  Be prepared to take a taxi through the permanent Istanbul traffic jam, or at the very least, make sense of the Istanbul ferry schedule, or walk some distance to get to the main tourist attractions in Istanbul from this location."

"152049","69741","1","If you're looking at the basic room, be sure to inquire if it has a view or not. This hotel has two buildings, and it's a bit of a rabbit warren to get to the back part of the hotel. If you have trouble with stairs, ask for the main building. As well, if you're getting a standard room, be sure to inquire what your view is. We snagged a great deal on our room, which was a nice room, but the view was of a rock wall. No big deal as we were only staying one night. If you're here for a few days, you definitely want a room with the million dollar view of the Nice Promenade."

We have never encountered a city where the rates and hustling in taxis is so widespread.  please keep in mind to specify you want a ‘taxi-meter taxi’ when you order a car service AND to specify to the driver to use the meter.  Otherwise the hotel (and every business in town apparently) will order what they term ‘a more elegant car’ – which is really the same car without the taaxi paint – and the rates can be up to 7 times the taximeter rate.  We paid between 20 & 120 pesos for the same ride, until we got our head around the costs.  Do not be put off by this, just know it."

"152732","70031","1","When they say that reaching the hotel requires a 4x4 vehicle they are not exaggerating.  If you are arriving in a car or other small vehicle simply park in Uvita and ask the staff to come pick you up.  The privacy and beauty of the hotel is magnified by being slightly further up the mountain than most cars can reach, so this only enhances the experience! "
"152735","70032","1","Some rooms only have hand-held shower heads. May want to insure your room has a shower if this is important to you.

Renting a little motorised boat to go around the islands was one of the best days out we had - plenty of places that do that and the hotel can set you up with a picnic.

"154284","70678","1","Rooms are EXTREMELY small and lack any style or accessories to match the great vibe in the common areas of the hotel. Many ""standard"" rooms feature a full size bed, and not a queen as indicated in the tablet hotels description. These rooms are even smaller so check the bed size when you check in. "

They will give you your coffee out in the patio if you prefer this over the dining room. There are also lots of fun games available to spend time in the common areas with the free-flowing cocktails. This hotel is the perfect distance away from all of the craziness of the tourist zone well still close enough to walk there when you wish."
"154390","70721","1","Enjoy some time in the common rooms downstairs. They have an amazing afternoon tea. And they also have a wide variety of cocktails and snacks in the honor bar area.

"154599","70810","1","Don’t be fooled!! One of the reasons to choose this hotel is the price. There is a non optional $50 “resort fee’ What does the resort fee include? The minimal amenities that all hotels include. the gym, coffee in the room, wifi etc. And the wifi that was included with the $50 resort fee was for a total of 12 hrs, 1 MB and only for one device. What a rip off!!"
"154602","70811","1","Park out front on sea front public promenade with busses.  Safer and easier. Winding your way to hotel parking in back street difficult and you can get stuck. 

No beer available - only wine. No one pointed out amenities or basement wine cellar so head underneath breakfast room. "

Take a walk in the area, including Mass Ave where there are several embassies"
"155083","71012","1","The lobby is placed on the 24th floor and the rooms are situated below that but to get to the elevators that even get to the hotels rooms you always have to pass through the 24th floor every time you come in and go out which becomes a bit annoying if you're staying for a few days. 
Weirdly enough the pool is located next to the lobby even though it's separated with glass walls but feels a bit strange if you're going for a night dip in the pool and people are having dinner and drinks fully dressed and can see you fully splashing around. "
"155086","71013","1","Would hesitate to spend more than a day or 2 here but good as a stop over. The hotel was small and other than beach and pool didn't have much to offer. Other guests said in bad weather it was a little boring. "

"155136","71034","1","We moved after one night to Post Ranch in, their cheapest room is less than Ventana, and the service, facilities and amenities are unbelievable.  We stay at resorts of this stature regularly and I was shocked at what you get for your money at Ventana.  There were no views, the rooms were claustrophobic and cramped (we saw multiple).  I would never recommend Ventana to another person.  

The view from the restaurant was beautiful, but the food was terrible.  They tried to pass off a buffet that was pitiful, and the service was non-existent.  Even after ordering from the menu we saw our waitress only to drop off the food.  

We had to follow up with the staff because we left something in the room, it took them 6 days to find it, and then they never called us.  After spending hours on the phone with them they charged us for shipping, which normally I would have understood but after the horror show they put us through I can't fathom how they justified it.  

There is nothing that redeemed that night for me, other than the fact that it was just one night.   "

You are in two minutes walking distance from the Guggenheim Museum, which is the most unique in all of Venice. The Water Taxis come regularly and the stop is 30 seconds away from the hotel. It is one stop from the main tourist area and three stops from the Biennale. A perfect spot to be in the quietest area yet close to the hustle and bustle. This was our first time in Venice and we were really happy with the Centurion in every way. "

Although the rooms are nicely done and fully functional, the public areas still have a bit of an unfinished vibe to them (or is that just the minimalist aesthetic?). Don't let that put you off though, it's a great place to stay in Queens."

"156051","71420","0","You should be aware this is not a normal hotel experience at all.. Especially for the price. Some rooms are sharing a bathroom in the hall so it is loud and had a ""hostel"" vibe to it.  The room set up is far from luxurious or even all that comfortable. The bathroom is not great. We are not stuffy or spoiled travelers at all but this experience and the hotel was really unimpressive."

"156068","71427","1","If you're booking a suite there is one in the top floor with it's own roof terrace which is definitely worth asking for as it doesn't cost anymore than some of the others... Unfortunately we found this out at the end of our stay!

The Metropole's restaurant has a few Michelin stars for a reason, we had the tasting menu for a birthday meal and it was quite simply incredible. Service was impeccable too!"

"156112","71446","1","Go to tablet plus "
"156115","71447","1","Extremely loud, which is to be expected in a hostel until quiet hours. But even after midnight when the music shut down, I could hear bottles clinking and loud talking from the common area beneath my private room. I had to wear headphones with white noise on all night. This is an excellent choice if you want to mix and party, but not if you expect to get any sleep. "
"156118","71448","1","As a small property, I believe that the staff prepares breakfast when guests come out of their rooms, rather than having it sitting around getting cold. Google maps does not show all the streets in the medina, so the last 1% of the journey to the hotel is a challenge to figure out as the streets don't show up on GPS. "

"156277","71516","1","You will find yourself in a very expensive room/bungalow and it will be shabby. The Chateau more than makes up for all things outdated with its soul, impeccable service and atmosphere. It is also very clean, the rooms are filled with amenities and, e.g., the mini bar is stocked up better than my fridge had ever been. For some people, however, this doesn't work and a room virtually across the street at The Tower will cost a third of what you will pay at The Chateau. "

"157083","71849","1","Two local tube services - shepards bush and shepards bush market. Shepards bush is a 6 min walk past the park opposite the hotel and brings you to the central line which has more trains and faster overall. We used Uber from Kings Cross back to the hotel at night for £6 and back to KC for £24 in morning rush hour. If traveling by taxi/car leave plenty of time to get back to airport/central London in the morning, lots of traffic in the area and connecting routes. "
"157092","71853","1","There's a lot of construction in the area (no noise  in the rooms however) so be sure to figure out your local walking routes via Google maps or with help from the front desk. Be sure to check out the bakery on the ground floor of the building; it's excellent."

"157318","71948","1","I don't think I can offer any tips for other guests, as the hotel management and staff has clearly covered all the bases that would create an optimum stay. I would of course recommend numerous trips to the lobby coffee bar which becomes a cocktail bar in the evening and to take advantage of the public spaces in beautiful outdoor spaces and all that the neighborhood has to offer. Of course a walk on Highline would be in order. I can't say enough about the professionalism and genuine hospitality of the staff."

"157413","71989","1","Rooms and corridors are really bad. The hotel will not turn the central heating system on until city's temperature goes below 50 degrees. So if you feel cold in the room, which happened to be our case, there is no way to warm up the room! We were catching cold in the room."
"157420","71992","1","Going to Shirley Heights is not worth it"
"157425","71994","1","Stayed in room 1604 and had a wonderful view to the West. Fitness centre is very small but actually well appointed with free weights and some cardio machines. Balconies are shared between two rooms."

This not the place to be seen if that is what you desire, this is the place where to find true comfort away from everything while still staying walking distance from the bustling downtown area."
"157532","72038","1","Ask for a room facing the street.  Some of the hotel rooms (including mine) faced each other.  I usually don't worry about privacy, but the other room windows were pretty close.  Additionally,  there is a restaurant or something below these inward-facing room.

It can be a beautiful ""big city"" soundtrack kind of thing if you are in the right mood, but after a while it can also get to be a bit too much. I can't say that it woke me, but it was present throughout the night."

Most importantly, do not expect redress if anything is stolen or if they make a mistake. 

We left this hotel one day early, on Christmas Day. We left because we had a terrible time and did not feel safe. A bag was stolen from the hotel room, they denied any problem, handled it incredibly badly, and accused us of lying. They treated us with contempt throughout and ruined Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. We had to organise new accommodation ourselves on Christmas Day. 

They did nothing to address the problem. After much arguing, they finally agreed to refund the one night we didn't stay. Which is clearly not sufficient remedy for the goods lost or the stress suffered. 

On another occasion, on my partner's Birthday (23rd December) we organised a driver for one day to go to a birthday lunch, a spa, and then a dinner. They said we could hire a car and driver for 1 day and this equated to 10-11 hours - they told me this twice on two separate days. As we got to 7 hours on the day (we started at 1pm), they started harassing us about the time. Saying we only had 9 hours. So I had to have a stressful call with their manager. This is after a birthday spa treatment (value of which eroded immediately afterwards) and before a birthday dinner reservation. Completely unnecessary stress that put us in a bad mood before dinner. Again, on return they completely denied agreeing with me 10-11 hours and accused me of lying. 

We were really incredibly disappointed. Collectively, the hours spent fighting with them were significant. They messed up Christmas and a significant birthday."

"158989","72656","1","Don't expect a menu selection of services like a regular hotel, but whatever you ask for they find a way to achieve what you request. I am exceptionally impressed esp since my daughter and I had a fever and they went out of their way to nurse us, give us comfort, take care of us. It's really like a home away from home."

"159058","72685","1","We're New Yorkers and found the location a nice respite from the city hum. Quick subway trip to SoHo or midtown. Don't count on your cab driver being able to find a Queens address without GPS. Bring slippers."
"159061","72686","1","Suite was facing walls and with zero day light"
"159066","72688","1","Se cercate un hotel a 5 stelle in un posto tranquillo non è il caso vostro.

Forse, nel giudizio complessivo, l'hotel è un quattro stelle lusso più che un cinque stelle."
"159069","72689","1","They don't advertise the availability of a western style breakfast, but they have one, and it is fantastic.

 Be sure to make dinner reservations ahead of time if you are traveling at a busy time.

The breakfast buffet is a delicious and a wonderful start to the day!"
"159138","72719","1","This is borderline all inclusive resort. It's small (85 rooms), but still big enough where it's not a small boutique hotel as it's advertised on their site. My husband and I never stay at all -inclusives, so the resorty feel was a surprise, yet we still very much enjoyed the privacy of our stay and felt we got a great vacation out of it. The extra curricular trips out of the hotel are about 4x what you might pay outside the hotel, so do your homework if you're interested in saving. The hotel also has an Avis rental agency within the reception, so if you don't have a car upon getting there it's easy to rent one one and you avoid the airport fees (12% in San Jose, and 3% in Liberia). "

"159172","72735","1","If you are arranging a tour via the front desk, the price is definitely negotiable! :)"
"159177","72737","1","The Vertigo is really a tourist grade hotel. Great for travelers who don't want to spend much/any time in their rooms. Towel and shower racks were falling down, heat had two settings, on and not on, rooms were dreary and the view of the Warsaw Ghetto was probably nicer."
"159182","72739","1","It's a great hotel with a rock and roll vibe - sort of like the Ace Hotel chain. Highly recommended"
"159185","72740","1","Handy location. Short walk to metro and central station. Nice 20 minute walk to the Doumo."

"159214","72752","1","Do not be taken in by the environment, not high end and snobby but more real and everyday; convenient to Metro use"
"159229","72759","1","Take the cooking clases, book 1 day before they are totally worth it as a family, couple or by your self.

"159291","72785","1","great location and service
"
"159294","72786","1","It is a bit outside of all of the main attractions. This is great as it is quieter and slower environment. However it can be a long drive with terrible traffic."

the casino and the restaurants are not in this building, they are in the other palm, accessible by the sky tube. not that close.
Also, it's not on the Strip, not even close. There's one shuttle that runs until approx. every 30 min until  8pm only and that services the Caesar's Palace only"

"159347","72807","1","SLS is an excellent choice for partying in Miami Beach while still being secluded in your own room. Older in feel than the Shore Club but younger than the Delano - less hipsterish and more nouveau riche dressed up - it consequently hits all the right spots. While dining in general is Miami-expected overpriced, it is worth every penny at the world class Japanese restaurant downstairs. A Miami must even if you stay elsewhere."

Also, make sure to check out the ""Love, Jaipur"" book in the hotel library, it helped us find some incredible gems in the city that would otherwise never be mentioned in regular guidebooks."
"159452","72852","1","The room was TINY, and the bathroom was even tinier.  You can see into the bathroom when the light's on, which is an unexpected surprise.  

Hotel bars were crowded and took forever to get some overpriced drinks, which we only bought because we were being charged a ""facility"" fee, $15 of which was for the bar.

The only thing good about this hotel was the location - very close to Lincoln center and MOMA."

The food is fantastic and the spread is overwhelming. We felt like royalty everyday, eating plates of cheese and baguettes (and fruit and eggs and croissant, and meat, and on and on....) in our robes as we planned the day ahead."

"159553","72895","1","The Japanese restaurant was a disappointment. Yes, the views are stunning but the food was surprisingly heavy and uninspired, with an emphasis on calories (amazingly, some reviews I've seen fault the restaurant for serving too little, suggesting North American appetites continue to rage out of control).

"161762","73825","1","If you're a light or even a semi-light sleeper, I would not recommend this hotel as the walls are super thin and we could hear ever noise and felt like we were living on the street. Venice Beach is a very busy and loud place, so the noise level certainly goes well into the night. Also, be prepared to have to find parking on your own on the busy Venice streets (good luck as we never found street parking the 3 nights we stayed) and paid $20-25/night at the nearby (and very crowded) parking lot.

The country is amazing though and getting a rental car (definitely 4WD thanks to the roads or lack of) is a great way to explore. Look forward to going back!"
"161786","73835","1","This is an ok hotel, no frills. Looks nice in photos but there are simple things not available, like a having a place to put soap in the shower or they give you too little shampoo/conditioner, or having more than one towel bar. Closet space is exposed as well. The pool seating area was not clean and full of dust. "

For the kind of trip my wife and I wanted, this was NOT the hotel we should have stayed at.  We found that all of the restaurants and places we wanted to go were in La Barra and Jose Ignacio which are VERY far away (45 minute drive).  The better, higher-end, trendy restaurants are nowhere near this hotel and we were constantly dissuaded from going to places in Punta Del Este.  If you are looking for any sort of action and life on your vacation, this hotel is not the place for it.  If you want a nice, clean room on the ocean and a relaxing beach trip, this hotel is good for that.  "

It's only about 1.5 miles to downtown Laguna so we opted not to rent a car and either walked or took uber everywhere. This was a good strategy for the weekend because we avoided having to drive or park during the busiest times.  The staff was really nice and gave us a discount on the overall room price because we had to deal with a lot of construction during our stay that we didn't know about prior to booking.  Overall, the pros probably outweighed the cons but I'm not sure I would stay there again due to location on the PCH. I would opt to pay a little more to be off the highway and right on the beach. "

3 of 5 starsReviewed 1 week ago
I rarely give a review this poor but all 4 people in our group asked that I give a very critical review. This was by far our most expensive hotel in Iceland and it did not measure up. 

Not a good value at all. Stay at the Hotel Budir, Hotel Ranga or Fire and Frost. All our better places in remote locations at a much better price point and with better Service and a better place to see the Northern Lights.

We had two rooms--one deluxe room and one standard room--there was not much difference between the two rooms.

Here are several things you need to know about before you book;

--Large Outside hot tub pool was one of the reasons we booked here but....it was only 93 degrees except in one spot. Windscreens were poor especially for the blustery night we were there. Nearly got frostbite on my face and the top of my head as the wind howled thru the hot tub area. With a thermal plant half a mile a way, there should have been no problem in keeping the water hot. Outside Temperature was 31 degrees so that should not have been a problem.

--Nobody made us feel as welcome guests in a special place. They had champagne glasses poored at reception but none was offered to us--not sure if that was an oversight. Service in general did not match the price point being charged guests. I think in this remote location it is hard to get recruit and keep happy the service personnel. 

--Rooms are very small (which I expected from other people's reviews) Just bad design in a place where we were the only building other than the power plant within 5 miles.

--Not a great place for viewing the Northern Lights. Lots of windows in the Northern Lights Bar but.....lights all focus inward to the bar versus out to viewing the lights. If you go outside you have lots of light pollution from the thermal plant which has many bright lights. Would be a much bett"
"163385","74516","1","The restaurant was very slow for breakfast when I visited the hotel. It took so long to bring out my granola and yogurt that I had to cancel my order and leave. It could have just been a bad day for them though.  "

You can walk or take a tram to most downtown locations-I'd walk as the streets surrounding the hotel are very cinematic. Lisbon is a city overloaded with culture-try to do some planning so you can get the important things in, including seeing the incredible history that this city is responsible for. Bairro Alto where the hotel is located has lots of youthful musical bars-fado is on the other side of town but you can walk there."

"164071","74808","1","This is one of my favorite type of places, that I know doesn't work for everyone ... It's not traditional 5-star palace hotel. It's worn around the edges but with great care and enormous charm. The rooms are kinda old (but immaculate) - and small (a good portion of the 300 sq ft regular room is in the walk-in closet with not-so-mini bar). We applauded the use of space but many might not. That said - the regular room was perfectly comfortable for a couple who really likes each other :-)"

"164352","74928","1","The rooms are extremely small, even by New York standards. They are well equipped and lovely, but extremely small. Our protocol is to get a regular hotel room and bring an air mattress for our four-year-old twins to sleep in the floor and when we walked in the room, we wondered whether there would be enough room to inflate the mattress. With some creative rearranging of the table and chairs, we all squeezed in, but next time I'll splurge on a larger room. "

"164451","74968","1","The location is perfect despite being in the 'business district' - there is a small park across the street for running; the Meiju Jingu Palace/Temple is half a mile away, and a mile away is the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden (the Cherry Blossom Park). This means you can enjoy three different parts of the Japanese culture with no effort. 
Shinjuku is a short walk away, where there are numerous stores from Gucci to Uniqlo to specialist coffee shops and boutique designer stores - you just half to walk and explore. 
Shinjuku station is a short walk too, and connects to all the main areas. In itself it is a sight as 3.6 million people pass through it every day - yet it runs very smoothly. 
The Park Hyatt could not be faulted for anything - location, decor, amenities, staff. I am not always an easy customer, but in this case I would recommend the Park Hyatt to anyone.

"165358","75345","1","Great public areas (by the fire or a champagne on the front terrace)  are worth exploring. Breakfast was a delight  and the desk staff are fonts of local knowledge. "

Restaurant August is nearby & very good though has a strict dress code during the week. "
"165400","75363","1","Try to get a booking at a great restaurant Maximo Bistrot - ask the staff to arrange before you get there as very hard to get a booking - note this is a 30 min cab ride away from the hotel. 
Use the airport taxi service at the airport to get to the hotel rather than the one booked through the hotel. "

"165528","75414","1","Be prepared: if you need a phone there won't be one, WiFi in reception and thats about it. If you want to get away from everything in beautiful countryside this is for you. Frankly everything considered its a little expensive. I never found the apparent friendliness of the Staff."

"165536","75417","1","Unbeknownst to me, my visit overlapped with a holiday week.  Apparently many properties (including this one) took advantage of this time for maintenance and renovations, making for an unexpectedly noisy, dusty experience.  The staff did their best to compensate, but it was just a case of bad timing.  Lesson is to make sure you check about planned work if you realize you'll be there during a holiday week."

"165683","75479","1","Bit of a walk to Mitte. Breakfast rather mediocre and the overall impression was not what one would associate with Tablet hotels. Also there is a massive building site directly behind the hotel which was not overly intrusive did rather spoil the aesthetic of staying in a supposedly special place. I will go somewhere different next time "

Be sure to wander to the Mercado at some point, have a taxi take you up to the Pipila viewpoint and then down into the city's tunnels.  And, if not faint of heart, check out the Museo de las Momias - a very unique experience."
"165814","75535","1","This is a very touristy area and not quiet. Be prepared to step out into Romab chaos.

"165842","75545","1","Its a good place for a night or maybe two , don't stay here if you plan on spending a lot of time in the Hotel itself, there are better options for that in the area. You can't really fault it and certainly not the Service which is impeccable  but there is no soul or character and there should be in Portugal."

"165973","75599","1","Maybe more shabby than chic in my particular room and hallway but still quite a charming hotel. Very few plugs to charge your devices, however (the only one I could find was in the bathroom--not great for my laptop). But you're in a great neighborhood and it's so easy to get here from CDG and various train stations. You're in walking distance from excellent restaurants and for that matter, only a 20-25 minute walk to the Seine. I found it a super convenient and very comfortable hotel."

The King Studio Suite was a perfect room for two people - enough space to enjoy getting ready and some drinks/snacks in the room without tripping over each other.

Really spacious. I felt like a had a secret large room in NY - great value if you can get a larger king room."

"166200","75697","1","The palazzo is not entirely made into a hotel, there are other rooms with residents living there or renting them out. There is no concierge, nor a reception area, so you are pretty much on you're own, which is fine if you're already familiar with Rome and do not require assistance with reservations/suggestions."

Buy a lot of cokes and snacks before you get there. Everything there is VERY expensive. We didn't buy enough. if you don't manage to do it in advance, just as you cross into Oman there are several convenient shops and they also take UAE Dirhams. 

Do the Paragliding arrival -- I made it a birthday surprise for my partner. He didn't know it was happening until we got out of the car and saw the parachute. His stomach flipped but he was very excited. Take a look at our flight...

Shore restaurant is nice and is more high end.  The other restaurants are just ok (sushi was disappointing) but poolside food is quite tasty.  This resort is quite far away from town or anything else really. If you are an explorer and like to get off premises for meals, rent a car. We used our car every day. "

I accept some fault for not doing a bit more homework on what it would take, but then again, have never had to. Never before stayed at a place with access quite like it. Regret staying here at all. Not even a cab can get you right to the door. Not a good place to stay if you have anything more than a backpack to bring along. "

"168675","76732","1","For food and drinks right then and there, you have to use the Starbucks, which forms part of the reception area. It´s a very pretty Starbucks. Of course, lots of eating out options round the corner. The room I had looked onto the interior passageway, no views whatsoever, a bit dim. The terrace is lovely and very spacious. "

Don't over pack."
"168696","76741","1","Rooms are reasonably proportioned but can be on the cool side (both the water view and others); there is no individual thermostat control (despite a control panel in the room).  Visited in May and too chilly to hang out in the room.  However, bathrooms are heated and warm.   Staff quality varies.  Some very helpful but other can be a bit brusque. "
"168699","76742","1","Some report rooms are too small which caused us hesitation at first.  We upgraded and our room was very happy.  We saw the smaller rooms - they are tight but still very nice - it ultimately depends on what is most important to you. We loved the hotel and will definitely return. "
"168702","76743","1","Don't expect a lot from the pool area.  It was windy and smaller than the pictures imply.  "

"168763","76769","1","Great location, comfortable, spacious rooms but relatively basic"

"168824","76793","1","This hotel is not on the beach. Hotel Juana has a sister hotel, the Belle Rive, that is a few minutes walk away where you can sit by the water. What they don't mention is that you have to PAY quite a lot of money to rent a chair, an umbrella and even a towel. Hotel Juana has a pool that is small and quiet, and basically located on the street with no view of the beach or anything else. (The beach in the south of France is not anything special but the water is beautiful to look at.)"

The staff accommodated a room change seamlessly. "

Petit détail si vous êtes un couple: les lits queen sont en fait 2 lits collés (ce qui arrive fréquemment) mais avec des ensembles de draps et couvertures également totalement séparés (ce qui est inhabituel). À noter pour les couples qui désirent dormir ensemble. "

"168865","76809","1","Don't stay here. "
"168876","76814","1","thoroughly recommend it. It's by far the best location for 5 star hotels in Copenhagen. I would say it's more like 4 and a half star, in terms of luxury level but the friendliness of the staff makes up for it. I love the coziness of the neighborhood. "

"168927","76835","1","Explore Old Town, Lindenhof, Limmat, etc.  Beautiful shops and good food.  Zurich is a beautiful city worth exploring, and CH is the most well run country in the world."

Also, take a right outside the building, and a right down the first street and there is a great café with good breakfast/lunch/snacks"
"168987","76859","1","Wine shop right outside in the tiny covered road on the west side of the hotel is great. The rooftop hot tubs are awesome, bring a bottle of wine up there with you. The hotel bar has a great cigar selection. Be sure to explore the fragrance options they offer for your bathroom."
"168992","76861","1","best to have some spanish language skills - but that isn't unusual in mexico city.   unless you are at a big chain hotel, or a large property, it is unlikely that you will have anybody to help you if you don't speak some spanish.   however,  you can send an email to the hotel contact, they will respond in english.   it wasn't a problem for us, as one of us speaks some spanish.

If you have to wait for check-in in the morning try Jonathan's coffee shop in the same area, very good value and free refills."

"169083","76896","1","Stay here! It was one of my favorite parts of visiting Stockholm. Borrow the house bikes for a nice ride around the neighborhood and be sure to take a meal or two in the various areas of the property (we ate breakfast mostly in the glasshouse outside but also had dinner in the kitchen one night and drinks in the library)."

Not much of a view as well and is located on a pretty busy and loud road. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. The restaurant looked modern and nice. "
"169136","76919","1","Ask for a higher floor"
"169139","76920","1","Great location, restaurant at street level is good but the rooftop is a must. Breakfast is great.

"169159","76927","1","This is not at all the hotel's fault, but this hotel is located right in the middle of Oia on ""the"" path for tourists taking selfies with the Caldera view. Pretty much zero privacy from the small terrace that serves as the hotel's only public space.

"169241","76963","1","Make a reservation for everything - upon arrival we were told that the restaurant was booked for the entire weekend. We eventually got a table but book in advance to avoid this. Same with the spa, we were not able to get in during out trip. "
"169250","76967","1","Rooms are small, but well appointed."
"169259","76971","1","This town was not on our original agenda and was such an unexpected treat.  The hotel was perfectly situated to check out the town."
"169266","76974","1","The outdoor bar gets busy for happy hour and beyond on with a mix of local people and guests. The atmosphere is very inviting and fun to be around, good cocktails but not great. I wouldn't say this hotel is for couples or small groups of people, I didn't see too many families. Also parking is in the rear of the building on the upper levels of the garage, valet didn't seem worth it given you could enter through the rear of the Andaz if you had a key. "

The formal gardens are impeccably kept and beautiful. The top of the garden offers amazing views of the city. Worth a visit.
Dinner in the rooftop restaurant was a treat! The views of the city and nearby landmark buildings at dusk were breathtaking, and the food was excellent."
"169375","77020","1","At least our room had toilet and bathroom separated.  The toilet is quiet small, so if you are a larger than normal it might not be as comfortable.  "

"169632","77125","1","We stayed in one of the less expensive rooms and it was quite small. We made it work, but it was the smallest of all the rooms we stayed in throughout Europe that had a similar price range. The hotel was lovely, so I recommend it. If I did it over again, I would stay there because everything else was wonderful, but I would spring for a larger room."
"169635","77126","1","Enjoy!"
"169644","77130","1","Check out the cool little 3rd floor outdoor deck, it rocks. Also it's connected to the French place next door, whose happy hour is synced up. From the hotel's free wine happy hour to the restaurant's champagne and oyster happy hour, the birthday was happy! "

The service person showed up... tried to fix it and then left.  I believe the room needs a new thermostat.  That said, ~$400/night with no AC is ridiculous."

"169806","77198","1","We rented a car from the airport to reach other local beaches and do some exploring. The hotel is right next to the loveliest, quietest part of Playa del Carmen, but they also recommended several other nearby beaches that were beautiful and remote. Well worth it!"
"169817","77203","1","Make your visit to this part of Algarve about the hotel and not about Algarve - the grounds are exquisite and te food is amazing.

"169855","77218","1","Stay at this hotel if you do not mind being 50min walking from the beach and you have business in the area. The value for the money is not ideal considering the plethora of options in the area for 50 euros+ less. "

"169878","77228","1","Note that it's really a serviced apartment set-up rather than a hotel. But there are great cafes close by (Barista Jam, Cupping Room, and others), so all you need is a great room. Which 99 Bonham definitely offers. "

On n'y va pas pour le service ou la qualité des chambres mais pour être dans un endroit branché et tendance"
"169893","77234","1","Ask for a room that faces west (I think those are the even-numbered rooms): If you happen to be in your room at sunset, the light and the view are gorgeous. Otherwise, you'll likely be overlooking the porte cochere. Also, just note that the pool is fed by the hot springs, so it is hot, as you can imagine - best to come here in the cooler months if you want to spend any time in the pool. Remember that this hotel is in a developing country, so the service may be slow and lackadaisical, and the resort ever so slightly run down. Consider avoiding the hotel during Ramadan if excellent service is important to you."

This was our tenth visit in the last three years, and I think I was crazy to believe that each stay would get better. Isn't that the definition of insanity?"

"170028","77291","1","The Tablet package is excellent. Some balconies are overgrown with vines etc, be carefull of the cheaper rooms"
"170031","77292","0","In order to capitalize on the outdoor assets of the property, they have a lot of events on-site outdoors.  In addition, they are trying to create a party atmosphere at the pool so the techno music is blasting whether there is anyone there or not. And they sell wristbands for day use of the pool which is probably a great asset for locals, but not necessarily a great thing for guests of the hotel.  All of this would be fine if you were going to the hotel for this reason.  However, if you are not, or you are unaware as I was, and many of the unhappy guests that I saw interacting withe front desk, you are likely to be frustrated and disappointed.  If you are looking for more quiet than party, ask for a street view room not a pool view room.   "

"170066","77307","1","great location. 
if you are sensitive to noise, consider asking for room that does not face central courtyard because of noise from bar below. I did not mind this, but could see how it might be distracting for sleeping to  others"

"
"170135","77335","1","Be aware that ""suites"" in the name of the hotel can be deceiving; the rooms are pretty small, though not necessarily out of the norm for historic center of Rome. While staff are very helpful, the hotel is basically just rooms & a front desk ... no restaurant or other facilities onsite. But if your highest priority is a central proximity to the major sites in town, then this is your place. Rooms are well appointed, but a bit of a squeeze. On front street side (Via del Corso), there is traffic & other noise below; however, the windows are thick & do a decent job of soundproofing."

However, if the hotel is hosting a party during your stay, you should not count on getting any sleep. During my stay the party lasted until midnight and then the guests continued to party on their own until nearly 4:00 am. I asked the office to ask them to lower the volume but to no avail. The staff are all nice but the hotel obviously would rather have the wedding and party business than individual guests. I'll go elsewhere from here on. "

It's a bit off the beaten path-- but that was the cool thing-- within walking distance of everything in Greenpoint, even Williamsburg.

A really great way to see Ana Capri and the location of the hotel is perfect!"

"171482","77889","1","Make sure to check location of your room within the resort. The hotel itself is not luxurious and more of a beach resort, therefore a beach view really is what makes the value. "
"171491","77893","1","Around the hotel the neighbourhood isn't the best in Paris. The square in front can also get a bit dodgy (sketchy). However, if you go to your left and explore the side streets there, you won't regret it! It's really amazing, full of life, with awesome restaurants and little shops to get lost in and enjoy the real Paris. That being said, I totally recommend staying at this hotel for a weekend getaway. If you can, just stick to the Sentier metro station and explore that side. Also, don't forget to try the brunch at the hotel's restaurant. Super convenient to have a cool atmosphere and good food downstairs from your bedroom! "

Aside from a quick trip to Bellagio and a tour of the gardens in Villa Carlota, all I did was enjoy the grounds of the Grand Hotel Tremezzo and can say I have no regrets.

Deluxe Room initially presented well from a design viewpoint but when we tried to use it for a 3-day stay had lots of basic layout and operational irritants, e.g. open shower with no door into the bedroom - cold and drafty, no desk or place to work, two chairs to sit in but at opposite ends of the room and with the back to the television, so I couldn't talk to my wife.  No drawers to store clothing.  Nothing too unpleasant, just irritating and not 5-star.  Front desk is both concierge and cashier so gets very busy.  "

Hotel is super close to the F train, which goes right into the heart of midtown - and the J, which goes straight to JFK (Air Train).  ... and it's in the best location in Manhattan for restaurants (both new world, foodie LES/East Village and old world LES classic NY) "

"172015","78112","1","Corner rooms are airy and come with a larger area."
"172018","78113","1","For what this hotel offers it is a touch overpriced. As other reviewers have observed the rooms are tired. Because of our connection to Tablet we were upgraded to a Junior Suite but the Suite was underwhelming. "
"172035","78121","1","Enjoy the modern clean and comfortable rooms! "
"172058","78132","0","Bocca di Lupo less than 5 minutes up the street when you arrive - and close to WholeFoods for your own water, etc!"
"172065","78135","1","Wonderful place to stay."
"172068","78136","1","Make sure to book Neni Restaurant-- guests do not have priority and we wanted to eat there our last night but they couldn't seat us until late- which would have been ok normally but we were so exhausted from our travels and had a lot of packing to do. "
"172081","78142","1","If bathroom privacy and windows / natural light are important to you, this might not be the hotel for you. The Tablet write up is right, compact rooms - our 'Deluxe' room didn't even have enough room to roll our suitcase between the wall and the foot of the bed. The bathroom had no door. The toilet room had a glass door that was good for visual privacy but that's where the privacy ended. The room had one very small window, and our 'city view' was of the building right next door. With limited natural light + harsh room lighting, even the light-colored interior couldn't banish the cave-like feel."

Close to Firenze's attractions, river views and stylish modern rooms. Excellent staff meeting guests individually- rested in a sofa.
A must stay when visiting Florence."

"172163","78175","1","Mid-July is probably not the ideal time to visit Ma'in, as the water in the cold water swimming pool is very warm and there are few cool places to rest. On the other hand, it is the ideal time if you want peace and quiet."

The train from the airport is 9 euros."

"172316","78238","1","This hotel is a wonderful opportunity if you don't need to stay in the middle of the city"
"172325","78242","0","The hotel is nice and stylish, but there are others in the area that offer more for your money. I33 for example is the same price and has more modern rooms (media plug ins) and bathrobes and toiletries. "
"172328","78243","1","Don't expect a Tablet Plus upgrade. Chateau Marmont sells out during high season. We booked a Standard room - which was a bit of a ""Bad Girl Closet"" . The Tablet rate was good, but the room was lesser than any I've stayed in at this hotel. A single room is probably best for a single traveller."
"172333","78245","1","Dine at Nico Osteria, is not only trendy but also a solid italian restaurant."
"172344","78250","1","Was on the 4th floor and didn't have any problem with noise. The pool can get crowded quick, it's not as big as the pictures make it look."
"172349","78252","1","The kitchenette rooms are near the street,so you will hear traffic,motorcycle noise ,and lights."
"172354","78254","1","Cani ben accetti"
"172359","78256","1","Make the most of the apartment facilities, have a long breakfast then do Brick Lane."
"172382","78267","1","If you don't smoke and don't like being in rooms where people have smoked there is a very lax policy in china to being able to smoke where ever you want despite it probably being illegal.  So if you really object to old smoke smelling rooms see if you can sort something out before hand - or make sure someone has had the air con in there for a while before you check in ...  If you don't speak Mandarin make sure you have the hotel address in Mandarin before you leave.  Another slightly obvious thing is there are issues in China with all google based products - google maps, googlemail + dropbox, tumblr, vimeo, soundcloud and pretty much any site that isn't Chinese.  The hotel has a pretty good VPN that navigates round this issue, but it doesn't always work (not their fault!) so be prepared to be info/data free (not ideal if you're working) or sort out a mega stealth VPN before you leave.  Probably everyone reading this knows this already but it was my first trip and i fell foul!  Uber also has issue with english locations and no taxi drivers speak english (but the metro is amazing and mentally cheap and literally next door to the hotel and all in english!)"
"172399","78275","1","Make sure you stay on the lower floor. And get the bigger room. "
"172402","78276","1","There are no public spaces for use for guests, the business centre charges for use, the gym facilities aren't great and a takeaway coffee for the room (no in-room facilities but plenty of room for them) is $5. But rooms are spacious."
"172407","78278","1","Hotel has a shuttle to take you into town/pick you up for a fee if you don't want to rent a car.  Don't miss Carrieres de Lumieres in Les Baux .  "

"172428","78287","1","Make sure you know all about the high tech settings in the bedroom 
We had trouble working out air con , blinds etc 
Beautiful new hotel , you just need clear instructions on arrival "
"172433","78289","1","Remember it is a European hotel so unless you make a major upgrade the rooms are smaller than in an American hotel but the décor and staff make up for that. The front rooms can be noisy, from traffic and people, if you want some air and open the windows but so can the courtyard facing rooms as the courtyard had some early morning activity that was noisy but not lasting. "
"172440","78292","1","Sketchy area but off Rambla so location was nice. Just be careful especially at night. "
"172449","78296","1","The hotel is overdesigned at the expense of functionality and practicality"
"172452","78297","1","1. There is a pantry or store room on each floor. If you are given a room next to this then the crashing and banging in the pantry or store room may disturb our sleep. 
2. The ordinary internet is free and I found it so slow as to be often unworkable (Wikipedia pages would not load after 15 minutes.) The hotel charges for fast Internet, which I found to be just as slow as the free internet. This hotel does not charge for air conditioning, TV, hot water, electricity or sheets, to why is it charging at all for Internet? This is 2017, about half a century after Internet was invented, and in the supposed IT capital of India.
3. As with all hotels in India, getting problems fixed can be a challenge. If a manager comes to your room and asks whether you are happy with how the problem was fixed, you might begin by asking him what he understood the problem to be. One manager in the hotel (I never had this problem with others) had no idea what the problem was in the first place, which made me think he had done nothing at all as a manager. 
4. If you are really expecting to watch TV in the bath (a new experience for me), this is not the hotel for you; the TVs in the bathrooms are much more for show than for actual watching, because the picture quality and sound are both fuzzy. "

They have amazing suggestions and pull strings to have guests taken care off 

Also for good places you must have reservations. Like booking beach day beds etc. Dinner lunch

Get jacuzzi room for sure   is heaven

"172511","78321","1","Ask to see other rooms if possible! I wanted a room with more character but the room we stayed in was alright but it would've been a more exciting stay with a room with more character! Also check & make sure the price you were given threw a 3rd party will actually be the price! If you want spa services check ahead to be sure you can get the spa services you would like. "

"172673","78387","1","Those visiting Matera should book a private walking tour of the town that can be easily arranged through the property. This will give you a deep understanding of the history of Matera. A sunset stroll through the hillside Paleo-caves is also a must see."

The sea view rooms are undoubtedly amazing (the view is perfect, plus it was larger and more luxurious), but if the price for sea view rooms is not accessible, I think the non-sea-view rooms are still worth booking. The views from literally every nook of the hotel are perfect and you can/will spend most of the time at the pool/ terrace/restaurants so having the view in the room is not crucial.
The pool restaurant is super overpriced and not great, while the breakfast and main restaurant (La Sponda) are exceptional. Have lunch in town or on the beach (Chez Black).

"173728","78830","1","Note that the hotel is a good 10-15 minutes walk from the nearest train station (and this station is not a subway station so the subway pass won't work for this train). Meguro subway station is even further away, probably 25-30 minutes walking or more (we always ended up taking a cab since it was too far away). As such, this hotel's location is great if you only want to explore the neighbourhood it is in (Meguro) but not very convenient if you plan on getting around town and seeing other parts of town as you will then find yourself paying for taxis a lot more than if you had been staying closer to a subway station. It's actually not even conveniently located if you want to explore the nearby (and really nice) neighbourhood Naka Meguro since this too is all to far away from the hotel to be within walking distance."

The reality is that the room was more a 2 or 3 stars hotel than 4.

There is a large pool party event every Sundays from noon onwards. While a lot of fun - and I thought the DJ was great - if you're looking for a relxaing afternoon at the pool, this is not the place for you! 
Also, the weekend I was there, there was a large group of people celebrating a birthday, and a bachelor party; both of which tended to dominate the pool during the afternoons. "
"174307","79072","1","The fact that Amigo has their own parking garage is certainly a nice perk, and rather affordable (I thought) for the location.  "

even at sale price, was too expensive for what you get. 

Try the Rex nearby, always a favorite.

"174581","79187","1","Don't order late night room service! I've never tasted such horrible room service before and basically was charged 50 pounds for something that was so disgusting, we didn't even eat it.  Days old fries it seems, a caesar salad that just had some greens and huge chicken pieces with just mayonaisse plopped everywhere, it was like they had just literally ripped off some pieces of refrigerator chicken and decided to squirt mayonaisse over it like a child was bored. The lamb burger as well - they attempted to hide the undercooked meat with cole-slaw.... We were just very confused and shocked. Basically, that just ruined the whole experience for us because we just couldn't believe anyone would serve that. We couldn't really get passed that experience so will never stay here again. 
"
"174586","79189","1","There is no restaurant or bar so you must leave the hotel just to get a coctail or beer or snack even. The outside space is cool but two of the three fire pits were broken. Parking is a little funky from where you park to where you check in but not too bad. "
"174591","79191","1","Enjoy the lobby bar area!  It's a great place to have coffee or meet friends for drinks.  
Explore the area as well."
"174594","79192","1","Sleep in a room in the main building if you like darkness. there is really not much to do so you need a book or you will do a lot of thinking. WiFi is good throughout "

"174632","79209","1","Great location to walk around downtown!  Find parking on the street.   It is cheaper than valet service!  The coffee shop around the corner has good coffee and empanadas for breakfast!  Great happy hour on the hotel restaurant's patio!"
"174635","79210","1","Make sure you request a reasonable size room. "
"174640","79212","1","Def go to the sauna.  Also, I'd recommend renting a bike and heading towards Alexander William Baan (or towards there), really remarkable countryside.  
Also, try De Bakkerswinkel, great cafe a couple blocks away-outstanding breakfast & lunch. Do stop by Dudok for their famous apple pie, their soups are good too!"

"174691","79233","1","If you are looking for a causal lunch or snack you will need to leave the hotel. While the restaurant does serve lunch, it is a three Michelin star experience, so casual is not totally available. Enjoy the pool early and sneak out mid-day for a casual while seeing the city. "

"174699","79236","1","Avoid Rooms 13, 14, 15 and 16 if you want to sleep as they are very noisy because of the road. Even with earplugs (boules quies) my nights were not peaceful. At this very high price I find it disappointing."

"174956","79343","1","They offer a 10 min massage as part of urban fee. The rooftop decks are great for taking a drink and hanging out. "
"174959","79344","1","The lack of perfection makes this a special place and also means that it's not for everyone. The new split-unit A/C kept the room very cool - even on a hot summer weekend, the linens were very nice and clean, the room was large and very comfortable. But the shower fixtures were a little touchy, the floor boards squeak, and the furniture is old. It's part of the charm and why we loved it so much, but if you prefer a modern hotel experience, go to a modern hotel instead. "

"175009","79365","1","Parking is in the public garage right under the hotel, but as there really is no place to stop to find out about it once you get there, best to call ahead and get directions."
"175016","79368","1","Do check out the nearby village of Pyrgos and climb to the top at sunset. Spectacular and far less crowded than Oia or Fira. Have a drink at Franco's. Visit the GAIA Winery (15 minutes by taxi) right on the seafront. Eat at Metaximas restaurant. Skip the clubby, blingy catamaran tours and go on an authentic family fishing boat here: http://www.santorini-fishing-tours.com/ – catch it and it will be cooked and served on board. Just wonderful."

Its pretty close to Union Square but at a steep incline!  Also its very comfortable but i'm not sure I'd rate it ""charming"". I booked in one night as a tester and while is truly a good hotel, think i'm going to try a smaller hotel (Rex? Vertigo? Clift?) for next couple days for hopefully something a bit more ""boutiquey"".  "
"175048","79381","1","Understand the neighborhood before you book.  It's not family friendly at night.  Lots of sex shops, several people in the streets offered us drugs when we were walking around the neighborhood late night, I imagine some prostitution.  I didn't feel unsafe late night, but I also wouldn't walk around late night with valuables. These things, though, are part of the charm.  "

Also the K-Town Run Club meets there for a quick 2-3 mile run Saturdays and this is a very friendly, welcoming, fun crowd.

"176084","79821","1","Ask if they're having an event. They had an event that went until 1am on the roof and 2am in the lobby (2 at once) and because events were on the upper and lower floors, there was nothing the staff could do...but they certainly were not very apologetic about it...which was tough when there on a business trip.

For families with children, pay to upgrade to the Jr. Suite. Well worth the price. Babysitting on site was available, a great treat for a weary couple ;)"
"176250","79888","1","Many of the rooms seemed to be in little mini-hallways of 3 rooms each. This is the type of room we had. It made the room feel more private because it wasn't on a long, exposed hallway."

It is located in the mostly pedestrian castle area.  Also ask the price.  We were charged 29 euros for a less than 20 euro fare from the airport."

if you like to run, this is also perfectly located to allow quick access to the river area as well as the part of the city that is interesting for a morning run.   
lots of people are afraid of Memphis; we found the City  to be edgy, but not creepy.   Memphis is spending millions on refurbishing old buildings, to retain the character of the City.   bear that in mind when you see an old grand building that seems to be vacant - it is likely being renovated. 
Use the trolley at night, from Beale to Madison St., if you are uncomfortable.  "

If cost allows look in advance to fly into the resort, it's a commercial small airline but the bumpy road is well worth missing!"

"178205","80696","1","Don't bother with the entry level priced rooms .... I stayed there in a suite on the 1st floor facing the square a few year ago & it was awesome. Staying on the 3rd floor in a normal room facing the courtyard was a completely disheartening experience "

"178261","80720","1","There are three Guldsmeden hotels on the same street - Bertrams is the least fancy of all three and also farthest from city centre (although Bus 6A from city will drop you opposite the hotel).

If you have luggage, note that you have to climb a flight of stairs to catch the lift and it doesn't go to the rooms on Level 3 (recommend catching to Level 4 and walking down!). "

"178393","80775","0","The 25th floor gets some of the noise from the Vertigo sky lounge. So if you are a light sleeper or go to bed early, request a different floor. "

"178445","80797","1","Great place to stay. Very low key."
"178448","80798","1","Tablet is great at upgrades. At this hotel that means a higher floor with a water view but all of the rooms are the same, very small size. I would stay again due to location, ambiance, quiet, and the quality of the room but be ready for small."

"178496","80819","1","Ask for a street-side view on a high floor for a killer view of the Empire State Building."
"178505","80823","1","Do NOT stay here under any circumstances - the Holiday Inn has better service.  There is NO customer service, NO room service, kitchen closed all weekend...how is this possible?  Can't even get a cup of coffee!  Smoke billowing through doors and music loud (starting at 5 a.m. - so strange) and front desk says they can't do anything.  NO service at all - the service did get was tons of attitude.  Employees are miserable.  Only shining light was Sam in the restaurant - who was polite, thoughtful and said he is upset at how the guests are treated in what once was a great hotel."
"178516","80828","1","There are rooms without bathtub, even for high grade rooms. Shower booth was excellent, but if you are keen to have bathtub, you should inquire with the hotel when you make reservation."
"178521","80830","1","Oddly enough, the suites in the main hotel offer a bit more privacy than the stand-alone one-bedroom villas. Plunge pool in the villa ultimately isn't as great as it might sound. "
"178532","80835","1","Take the ocean view suite !"
"178537","80837","1","Do not plan on having a meeting at this hotel...there is no place to meet.  It's more like studio apartments.   The staff was nice, but don't expect a concierge.   They had no idea where to recommend is to go to dinner.   There is no breakfast room or lobby.   Its an apartment.  ""Palazzo""  is the wrong descripting of this building.  "
"178540","80838","1","A very special place.  The suites with fireplaces are wonderful, quiet retreats high above Chicago's  Gold Coast."
"178549","80842","1","Nice quiet area. The hotel is surrounded with art galleries...
The roof top is amazing... when opened (Spring / summer).
Nice hotel."
"178552","80843","1","The bathroom had not been cleaned.
I was told I could only eat at the bar as I did not make a booking.
I had to carry my bags myself on the way out.
Not what I call a good customer experience overall.
"

"178591","80859","1","If you intend to take daytrips to other towns to see the region, think twice before choosing this hotel.  The remote parking can become a hassle.  One time we waited 30 minutes at the remote lot to get picked up. 

The room descriptions can be misleading.  Our ""deluxe"" room had a skylight, and that was after we complained and were moved from another deluxe room that had more of a small sky portal; you won't see anything from those rooms.  The room itself was finished well and spacious."
"178604","80865","1","It's a little too American for Americans.  I was curious because I am an Andre Balazs fan, and it is lovely, but next time I will seek more British accommodations. "
"178609","80867","1","Very easy to get there by cab from Fiumicino, but we were travelling light on a quick city-break and used the Leonardo express and then the Metro to Spagna, which was cheap, easy and convenient."
"178618","80871","1","Do breakfast at the hotel only when you want a quick and immediate option. There are many lovely options for outdoor cafes within a 305 minute walk.  Nice to mix it up a bit. Rue Cler is a must and it's literally a 4 minute walk. You'll love it here!"

"178714","80912","1","My type of the room was facing the other windows across and I was forced to put the curtains all the time, even when it was so sunny! I could not go out of a bath naked, because I saw in details what are the other people were doing inside the buildings across... I asked to change the room, but the other option (in my category of the room) was exactly the same...((
Also, I was hearing all sounds from the corridor... In a word, I did not feel I am having a full rest.

"179663","81312","1","Room was small. I hated the neibourhood and most importantly my husband had to eat his breakfast standing on a moody morning because they had too many people in the lounge. Breakfast was not great. Worst a,he for money place I have stayed in a very long time and certainly not deserving Of an 18 rating. "
"179666","81313","1","Don't bring large luggage if you're staying in a mignon sized room!  Small room, but has everything you need. Have the hotel book your restaurants in advance of arrival. "

"179682","81319","1","Get to know Vincent.  He's great.  The beach is pretty but the water is better for watersports than for casual swimming.   Ask the pool guys for chairs and towels and they'll set you up for a trip to any one of the other amazing beaches on the island (Gouveneur, Colombier, Tom Beach etc)."

"179732","81340","1","Just try it :) worth the price!"
"179753","81350","1","Take time to explore the network of overhead walkways and the underground connection to Shimbashi railway station that surround the hotel.. This were you will find places to eat, drink and shop. There is little at street-level. Make sure you ask the concierge to write your destination in Japanese if taking a taxi.

"179769","81356","1","Get your reservation reconfirmed and be very specific - they will try to blame the others (i.e.. Tablet) for their own inability of a simple request such as one bed instead of Twins and will try to charge you for it which is ridiculous. After all it is the same room in terms of square footage, etc."

"179807","81373","1","The drinks in the bar were quite expensive"
"179816","81377","1","You can order an espresso in the restaurant and expect to get an authentic one - not the usual hotel restaurant coffee disappointment.    The cocktails were outstanding and the food was delicious. "
"179819","81378","1","Consider an upgrade.

Caveat: the hotel is not accessible by car (a minute walk) and the address is a little vague, so have the taxi driver call reception for instructions."
"179882","81404","1","Incredible (& cheap!) late night sushi at Ryoko just a block up the street. Let the staff help you with your Uber/Lyft request. 
Forgot something? The hotel has some sundry items at the desk, but for what they don't have, there is a CVS on the same block as Saks (just 2 blocks toward Union Square)"

"179979","81444","0","Definitely ask for a room overlooking Bryant Park.  The Mon-Fri complimentary drinks in the Cellar Bar between 5-6pm is a very nice touch - they offer a good selection of decent wines 'on the house'.  There were spirits available too."

"180051","81474","1","Spring for a room with a  museum view and get coffee at the rooftop restaurant at least. "
"180064","81480","1","Beware, the rooms are rather spartan and industrial. Very little furniture. No closet. The sheets didn't feel as luxurious as other properties I've stayed at and the room was quite noisy (heater and hallway traffic) and I'm a New Yorker."

the views from the guest rooms are mostly of 
parking lots and industrial buildings. the hotel is so over-designed as to feel like a manor house in the middle of the jungle, but yet it's in the middle of what is essentially urban blight. so though it's beautiful, it feels a bit off. "

The larger rooms are only on the lower floors (2-6) and on the loud side of the hotel (west facing).  They were also fairly dark, which can be tough in the winter.

The room was nothing like the picture. It was dark and dungeon like and the sliding doors which were the only windows to outside and blinds were filthy dirty."
"181445","82062","1","Very quiet"
"181450","82064","1","Make sure you eat in the restaurant and enjoy some punch in the punch bar. Gym is also one of the best hotel gyms we have encountered. "

"181503","82085","1","if you are looking for a value hotel this one is good.  amenities and F&B was less then great.  staff was helpful.  was a little disappointed that when i needed to make a change to my reservation i had to go through Tablet however they did make the change very expeditiously."

"181582","82118","1","Book it and make sure to enjoy a couple of exquisite cocktails in the Oriental Bar. We went the week before Christmas and enjoyed a thoroughly relaxing experience. Although breakfast is not included in the price we paid for our room, they have a rather pricey 35 euro option; however, there are numerous cafe's within a short walk providing some very satisfying and less expensive options."
"181585","82119","1","A great small boutique hotel, with small but efficient and stylish modern guestrooms. The breakfast was fantastic;  eggs, ham, cheese, cereal, pastries, coffees, juice etc. Located right by the Piazza Navona down a tiny cobbled road at the north end of the piazza and just a block from the Lungotevera Tor di Nona that runs along the Tiber, great location, walking distance   to so many major attractions. 
Not a good fit for anyone with any ambulatory restrictions, the hotel's stairs are a tight fit. "
"181594","82123","1","Ask for a room closer to the elevator. Hotel seems to be in multiple connected buildings and it can be a hike to get back to the elevator and the stairs could not be used to get out on ground floor. "
"181597","82124","1","good F&B outlets nearby"
"181602","82126","1","Rooms in the 40s face the restaurant and are loud. Rooms on the ground level are bigger with fireplace and patio. "

"181650","82149","1","The hotel is fairly poorly marked except for room numbers and there is no comprehensive map in the rooms.  It's best to get good directions from the front desk staff if you want to access ice and vending machines, or the elevators.

"181673","82158","1","The airport limousine bus from Haneda goes right to the hotel. It was very easy. "
"181676","82159","1","Only book if you get a very good rate. That will make up for the below par rooms. Everything else was great. "
"181681","82161","1","Consider an Oriental Club room. For us, it was a very small increase in price and more than worth it. Be sure to enjoy the breakfast buffet on the 4th floor - one of the best we had in China."
"181684","82162","1","The breakfast buffet is included in all rooms and is really mediocre."
"181687","82163","1","Staff are there but not in the way so one can relax and go about business; not pampered but treated respectfully"

"181709","82172","1","Standard king size room was possible the smallest hotel room I've ever seen. Literally it was the bed and about a foot of space from the wall on each side.

The bathroom was relatively huge, almost as big as the room. Only downside was the shower had very low water pressure."
"181714","82174","1","Eat at the Bistro downstairs.  We normally prefer to explore an area we visit and avoid eating where we are staying, but you would be missing out on a great meal."

"181734","82182","1","-Check-in and Check-out can take a while (processes)...and the wait for the elevators could be somewhat long, depending on how booked the hotel is."
"181737","82183","1","Our room was not the warmest in winter, although the hotel is fairly new. Travelling to the Old Town takes about 15 min by car, and you'll likely have to catch a taxi yourself."
"181740","82184","1","if price is your driver, and being in the heart of Asakusa is preference, this place does the job.  otherwise, there are much better places to stay for not much more."

"181746","82186","1","Very over priced compared with Cinnamon Lodge, pretentious service and poor quality Sri Lankan food"
"181753","82189","1","eat at nahm.  and if you can't get a rez, as the hotel to put you on the waiting list--you may eat late, but almost always get in.  and go to the pool early if the hotel is packed.  it's gorgeous, but has limited lounge space."
"181758","82191","1","A great affordable night, a sweet little pool, but the room could have been a little nicer.  Oh, and it is not a rooftop bar with a view of Dallas, it's a cool outdoor bar, not rooftop!"
"181761","82192","1","This hotel is tall and narrow with one slow historic elevator. The location is on a one-way system which means Uber drivers can be confused and you'll need to meet them on the corner of the building not directly outside.
"
"181764","82193","1","Parking is a bit trying "
"181767","82194","1","Afternoon tea is a bit pricey but worth the experience (and price is actually competitive with other services). Explore the local pubs in the area; Anglesea Arms and Drayton Arms were two favorites. Hotel is an easy walk from South Kensington Station. "

"181810","82211","1","Corner rooms are nice."
"181813","82212","1","If you are bothered by the grime that can come along with the urban environment, this hotel is not for you. It's confidently located in the city center and what comes along with that is noise and a close proximity to the Tendeloin which is full of homeless and folks in need of help. "
"181816","82213","1","This is a pretty good option for a midrange modern hotel in SF. It's right next door to SFMOMA, close to other museums and 10 - 20 mins walk to the subway and Union Square."
"181821","82215","1","Finding the front door can be difficult. Have your driver take you to the address and look for the large wood double doors, the doorbell is on the right! Very small sign! "
"181824","82216","1","The holiday season is very busy, so be sure to make dinner reservations, including at the hotel."

"181939","82263","1","Well designed and maintained property. Great location, close to sights, public transport, etc. 
Great value!"
"181942","82264","1","Ask for Tokyo tower and Fuji views"
"181945","82265","1","Take advantage of the restaurant. The food is great. "
"181948","82266","1","Nice property. Be aware pool chairs fill up and hotel has a policy to remive unused towels so as to make room for new guests, but they do not folliw thru.

Some hotel offers/tours/foods multiple times more pricey than off property. "

"181977","82277","1","Really cool building, but as others mentioned, this is in a cool redevelopment of an industrial area outside of the city center. So you'll be only 4-5 SBahn stops, which is short. Kinda nice to walk home with everybody living around. The good thing is this place is super quiet. You can get anywhere on the SBahn from here."
"181982","82279","1","Definitely ask for a room on the 2nd floor. And make sure they aren't doing any construction during your stay!"

"182050","82306","1","Overall we were very dissatisfied with our stay.  Upon our arrival, we parked our rental on the street, unloaded our bags and walked 50 ft to the check in desk, where I handed my rental car keys to the valet, since there was not one on the busy street. within that 2 minute time period, the police had already booted my car.  the hotel then made me pay a $45 fee to the police to have it unbooted, which the hotel should have paid given their poor check-in and valet service. "
"182053","82307","1","Find a different hotel. The Standard is overpriced for quality of the facility, rooms and spa. The service is inconsistent and at times unfriendly."
"182060","82310","1","Upgrade to deluxe room when possible, the basic rooms are quite small"
"182063","82311","1","Buy paper towels and milk, but not a big box of detergent. We broke our stay into 2 parts and they threw out everything we left the first time. Also check sheets and bathrooms for cleanliness."

"182076","82316","1","Be mindful of staying on the 7th floor (right below the roof top bar).  The staff is very loud when they are cleaning/closing for the night.  It was very loud between 1:00 am and 3:00 am and I am not a light sleeper."

"182111","82330","1","This place really is VERY quiet, which is great if thats what you're going for. But be aware that there's definitely no fun scene at the bar or Nothing like that. For perspective, the bar and restaurant didn't even stay open till midnight on New Year's Eve."

"182160","82350","1","Book a room with a view of Duomo - is totally worth it as the view is something you can not get from other angles - to see the detail and sections not visible from below 

the tower suite is incredible duplex with huge floor to vaulted ceiling impossible to describe.  Having traveled all over and stayed in many amazing hotels this room - tops them all.  huge round bed - the original sixth century stone, and the unrivaled view.  Even jacuzzi bath in lower level with beautiful lounge room.  

Its worth the splurge and because of Tablet  they upgraded us to this room as a special surprise 

Well done tablet

The concierge was excellent. recommended great restaurants and got us difficult to get bookings. 
 
book dinners for the most part for good places - they get full.  Its florence.  

also ask for appetitivo bookings as the popular ones and more interesting also get full. 

wake up for breakfast -the food is lovely and the prosecco excellent "

There's also a fabulous Steakhouse across the street as well and a well known Udon restaurant.  The grocery down the road is also open 24 hours in case of severe jet lag in the middle of the night. "

"182777","82609","1","One night an apartment in the neighboring building  had very loud music which carried into my room until at least 2am, when I finally fell asleep  Other rooms might be quieter than those on the east side of the hotel, next to the cafe and apartments above."

"182967","82691","1","In my opinion this hotel is not of the usual Tablet standard. It is not especially luxurious or attractive. 
The stairs are daunting and the ""included Continental breakfast"" is of airline standard. Value for money perhaps for younger couples, but poor value for the older solo traveller. "

"183327","82842","1","See what we wrote under""what hotel can do better"" Shown below:
""Three things do NOT work in the rooms. We noticed this in the summer( 2016) when we visited AND just now(late January 2017) The hotel is an old building and ( sad to say) it appears the problems we mention cannot be fixed. The front desk, although they are not allowed to say so, appear to agree. 1.The showers do not work well: very noisy ( loud rumbling) on an intermittent or more regular basis and there is a struggle (not always successful) to have them switch from hand held to overhead. Most annoying first thing in the morning. Old plumbing is the issue, we suspect, which is too expensive to repair. 2. the bathroom sink does not drain well. Both times we visited. Two different rooms and floors. Old plumbing explains this too since promises( both visits) to fix from the front desk are not delivered. 3. the a/c in the summer and the heat in the winter is uncontrollable. we froze in our room in the summer and roasted in the winter( almost 80 degrees...).
We are so sad about this.We really like this hotel otherwise. But...nothing is WORSE than being told that something can be fixed when in fact in cannot or will not be done."" "

Hallways were dark and dirty.

"
"183368","82859","1","Not a great choice for kids or those with limited mobility, as there are some steep stairs to navigate. There are a couple of nice ground floor rooms, but you'd better specify that if you have trouble with stairs.

"183415","82879","1","Not a world class hotel that should command these prices. Don't waste your money on boat trip as the water and beaches in the surrounding islands and not great. One place we went to swim we couldn't see 10 cms in front of our eyes."
"183418","82880","1","This is truly a hotel for relaxation and rest, you can explore the local town and nearby community but if you're looking to be downtown this probably isn't for you. Should have a car for transport."

The hotel room was one of the worst I have ever stayed in. I've stayed in cleaner and bigger motel rooms. When we asked to swap room, we were told there was nowhere quiet to stay in the hotel, because of the hotel's location. This hotel primarily caters for stag & hen-dos - so expect a great deal of rowdiness and chaos. Oh, and they have the audacity to charge premium prices. If you're travelling to Liverpool, head 5 minutes down the road to the Titanic. Brand new converted warehouse. Spacious rooms, great facilities and friendly staff - none of which you'll find at this establishment. And it's half the price. "

"183926","83096","1","The room I had was small but the bathroom huge. Thankfully I'm 5'2"" but for those who are not, I'd opt for the bigger rooms. 

Take advantage of the view on the rooftop, the patio/bar area to enjoy a beverage or do work, and eat the food at Dirty French!! 

There's an adorable coffee shop a few doors down for some delicious pastries. Not sure how long it's been there or how long it'll stay, but go. Russ & Daughters has the most amazing selection of smokes salmon/fish, deli stuff and  Jewish bakery items. Few short walk from the hotel. "

"184083","83164","1","The heat system can be noisy in the middle of the night - it's a 100+ year old building with equally ancient radiators. Very hard to get a cab right outside the hotel so be prepared to walk 2 blocks east to busier streets. If you come back late from dinner you have to jockey the nightclub waiting line to get to the guest elevator. Drinks in the noisy bar/nightclub are insanely expensive ($25 for a stella and a whiskey) "

"184141","83187","1","It's a very relaxed and informal, yet exclusive place, if you are looking for staff who stand in line for you, it's not the right place. It's more of a great home away from home.  It's not a great place to bring younger kids. It's simply not catered for children. Only the suit has a fully enclosed toilet, all other rooms have one ""open"" wall. Does not suit all people."

"184244","83229","1","This hotel is more geared towards business travelers. From the attire and vibes of the staff, it seems like they can't figure out if it is a hotel / serviced apartment or something in the middle. Entirely pleasant and nice staff as well as well decorated rooms. Just don't expect to be wow-ed by the out of the ordinary. This is a very ""ordinary"", albeit nice and with great service. I just expect boutique and unique when I come to tablet."

If you opt for one of the larger rooms (e.g., 2 bedroom lodge or estate lodge), note that the rooms are not connected and you need to go outside to walk, for example, from your kitchen to your living room or one bedroom to the next bedroom.

"185027","83553","1","The hotel is located on a busy main route into central London. The rooms at the back are very quiet, those at the front probably less so. Equally the immediate environment around the hotel is pretty uninteresting but a few blocks away there are excellent cafes, restaurants and supermarkets.  Some research on the local environment will thus pay huge dividends."
"185040","83559","1","No lamp or night table on one side of the king bed
Room service really inflexible, for people who have food allergies and had a long day of travel.
Shower had very little water pressure.
We were told we'd have a view of ocean, but all we had was a view of other rooms.
Coffee wasn't available in restaurant at 8:30am
Umbrellas weren't available during pouring rain storm to get coffee a block away"

"
"185213","83631","1","There is only a small waste basket. The TV wasa bit difficult to figure out, but it is in the mirror on the wall. The hotel needs to place a sign or notice on the remote or nearby."
"185224","83636","1","This may well be a British 'thing' but there are no tea & coffee making facilities in the rooms.  There is room service available 24hrs, but that can be an expensive option for multiple cups of tea over a 1 or 2 weeks holiday period. "

"185283","83660","1","Ask for a larger room.  They upgraded us at check-in, and it was nice to have a bit of extra space.

Try the fitness room - not too bad for a hotel gym.  

Don't miss the happy hour where they offer complimentary wine & beer.  The setting is cozy, and you get a chance to chat with other hotel guests."
"185286","83661","1","This is a place to go for relaxation and quiet, not really an adventure vacation or a place to bring the kids to run wild (which is why we chose it).

Use the spa - you will not regret it!"

"185345","83687","1","The rooms vary wildly. The rooms that face the street are great and the bigger ones are amazing, but the small ones can be frustratingly mall. "
"185348","83688","1","Not near sites or downtown London, but worth the taxi ride because the service and rooms are so nice."

"185372","83698","1","I understand the hotel will be going thru a renovation to upgrade common elements in the near future - check status.  The hotel gets top marks for sleep comfort & the rooms are immense. Spa, gym & pool facilities appear to be underused.  Recommended for those seeking a gentle, personalized, adult experience. "

"185396","83708","1","Have rooms face the street, not the courtyard (gloomy). Noise insulation via double windows is good."
"185407","83713","1","Dinner at the on site restaurant, Mashya is an absolute must.   

The Design Museum in Holon is decidedly worth the 20 min taxi ride to get there. "

"185450","83731","1","Try for the art rooms if you can afford them."
"185455","83733","1","If you want a room with a view on the skyline, you will also be facing the hydroplane base, so you might have a little noise and kerosene smell (though with closed windows this is not really a problem)."

"185505","83755","1","This is a nice, typical, old school French resort property. Nothing special in style or substance. Pleasant. Best when you can enjoy the outdoor terrace and pool + ocean views. That's the draw.
Make SURE you get an ocean facing room...the rest aren't that great."
"185510","83757","1","Every room is different and some are gorgeous. So check out the room first"
"185519","83761","1","It is worth staying here!"
"185524","83763","1","If you give the Villa advance notice, you can enjoy a light lunch or dinner on site, which is highly recommended. Rent a car and explore the village nearby and the other towns close to Arraiolos. Ask for recommendations - François and his team are very knowledgable and asking questions led us to some of the best experiences from our trip."
"185529","83765","1","It is important to note that this is a very lively hotel! While the rooms are quiet and very tranquil, the public spaces are very busy and it becomes quite a club in the evenings. If you are looking for a quiet place to have a glass of wine or a dinner, this is not the place! If you are looking for an active and lively club feel, this is the place for you!"
"185538","83769","1","We just returned to the Montalembert after the near completion of a major remodel. It did not disappoint. While the rooms are on the small side by US standards - they in no way feel cramped. The modern furnishings are beautiful and integrate stylishly withe historic features of the property. The new bathrooms are luxe and I love that they now have hardwood floors. But the real star at The Montalembert is the service. Everyone who works there - from the doormen to the people in the restaurant - are friendly and so on top of their game. We stay there a few times a year and I am always pleasantly surprised to be greeted by name by almost every employee. The location is superb with all the Left Bank offers and the Louvre just ten minutes away by foot as well. I highly recommend the Montalembert. I can not wait to go back.   "
"185543","83771","1","Plan to spend time in the hotel and in your room. It is too fabulous to use just as a place to sleep! "
"185546","83772","1","Come for 1 or 2 nights and take full advantage of the pool, lawn and spa. Then go somewhere else for the remainder of your stay in Miami if you want to get true rest at night. I'd definitely come back, but just plan on napping by the pool to catch up on the sleep you'll miss at night. "

"185659","83820","1","great vibrant interesting area of the city"

"185690","83833","1","Try to stay on a higher floor.  Downstairs is a bit of a scene. "
"185695","83835","1","try staying on the other side facing hills and do emphasize to the hotel that the windows really need to be updated to a double-layer to mitigate the noise.  Looks like hotel is gping to work on this. Will see.  "

"185742","83854","0","The rooms are small and dark, although smart and clean, the trade off for the great value in price.  Perfect option if your plan is to be out all day and use hotel for sleeping, not so comfortable if you want somewhere for lounging/hanging out in."
"185751","83858","1","For this price, book a standard chain hotel. The rooms were not up to Tablet standard. "

Heading up to the sky bar is a must - great views, amazing drinks, and decently priced. If in BA for longer than a few days, I would stay in another neighbourhood like Palermo or Recoleta."
"185892","83915","1","Book a room overlooking the Presidential Palace, facing the direction of Old Warsaw. Stunning views - it's a visual feast for the eyes.Grab a coffee at the historic Cafe Bristol on-site or a drink in the Wine Bar."

"185942","83937","1","Don't be alarmed or fooled by the neighborhood. It is rough-ish looking but quite hip and interesting with LOTS to offer. Additionally, Melbourne is so easy to pop from one part of town to another that if you get tired of Fitzroy's grafitti-hipness, you can simply visit another part of town.

"186082","83996","1","Ask for rooms on each end especially the north end where the rooms have three street exposure so windows on three sides and great breezes.  Remember that many hotels have central HVAC systems and in March they wont have A/C.  We didn't mind sleeping with our windwos open though.  As is the case in many urban hotels higher floors can be quieter and the suites are usually on the top floors.  It pays to use the Tablet  Plus membership!

The elevators are still old and worn and a little dirty, the bathtubs are clean but old and cracked in places. The beds were great, the food was solid and the people working there were nice.

"187288","84506","1","Beware that the rooms on the Sunset Blvd side of the hotel are very loud.  I booked the Hollywood Hills view room, but they didn't honor that at checkin.  If you want a quiet nights sleep, I'd look elsewhere."
"187293","84508","1","If you ask the front desk for breakfast recommendations, they will give you great ones. Thanks to them I ended up grabbing a breakfast sandwich at Gjusta and eating it on one of the hotel's pretty turkish beach towels on a lovely stretch of the beach. "

"187317","84518","1","The rooms that face the street are SO loud from traffic. Ask for a high floor or a room that faces the hills. Also room service ends promptly at 10p, even on the weekends. I arrived late from a flight from NY and I called for room service at 10:05 and they wouldn't make an exception. The last thing I wanted to do after a long trip was go back out searching for food. It aggravated me. Also my original booked room (the Hills view) was unavailable when I checked in so I had to deal with the noisy street view room. "

"187417","84561","1","Bring your own toiletries as I felt the ones they provide to be too tiny. However, they do replenish them daily. The mini bar isn't fully stocked so the good news is they have a wine bar downstairs which you can order from and bring back to your room. "

If traveling from Noto to Catania skip the Conde Nast recommended restaurant I Razzari. The views were nice, but the staff was just awful to us and other guests."
"187589","84634","1","The hotel has a nightclub vibe - lots of dark browns etc. - throughout."
"187592","84635","1","Consider opting for a villa - not offered on Tablet's site when I booked, but I was able to change the booking with Tablet's help. Having a private pool was a nice feature. 

The main pool area is very comfortable and even though I was there on a busy holiday weekend I never felt remotely crowded. The main pool also gets a great breeze which is welcome at midday. 

Weather forecast in Phuket is completely unreliable - days my iPhone said were going to be stormy were sunny and beautiful.

"187749","84702","1","Although the hotel was wonderfully quiet overall, I did experience some noise as my room (on the 6th floor) was on the Meeting Street side of the property. This was mostly in the form of loud mufflers, motorcycles and boom box cars, as Meeting Street is a busy thoroughfare. I also heard pounding bass from music outside, often late into the night. I believe this may have been coming from the hotel across the street or maybe even music venues nearby.  It might be quieter on the East side of the hotel (the side with the motor court entrance)."
"187754","84704","1","Far enough away to be completely secluded, but only 45 mins by jet boat from the airport so not a chore to get to. Lack of pretension made it more relaxing than some of the more swanky resorts."

"188519","85029","1","This is in the perfect location.  The new Browns, though by the sea, isn't as cool.   The deck is a real bonus and the location, near Neve Tzedek, makes this idea for the well-traveled. "
"188530","85034","1","I prefer the view facing the Hikarie Department store/Tokyo tower so request if available.  Super convenient because the limousine bus stops right at this hotel.  "

Lunch in the lobby restaurant very pleasant."
"188596","85063","1","Ask not to be near the elevators.  You would be kept up all night by the ding of the elevator and guest talking as they enter and exit the elevator.  Try the Crepery for breakfast one block away on Taylor Street.  Outstanding food."
"188599","85064","1","Bear in mind that room service only available when the restaurant is open, which is not a problem but might be a bugger when its Sunday night in Berlin when literary everything is closed."

"188611","85069","1","The hotel is a little out of the way if you have difficulty walking. It took us around 30 minutes to walk to Albert Dock & then into town. However taxis are reasonable and it was under £5 to get to/from the centre of town. "

When asked what this covered a was told wi-fi and gym facilities - i.e. things that other hotels include in the price. It also covers a $10 credit for food/drink per day. I was told about this credit when checking in (although not about the facility fee) and thought that it was a nice gesture. I didn't at the time know that I'd be paying for it, whether I used it or not!!!

Also the rooms are very small indeed, although nicely decorated."
"188846","85170","1","I wasn't able to access the pool/roofdeck during my stay due to routine maintenance. Might be worth verifying that it will be open during your stay. "

"188860","85176","1","Don't miss sitting late night by the big window, where the two chairs are in the lobby – and, if you like cycling, make use of the nearby Vélib (city bike) dock! It only takes ca. 40 min. to cycle out to Fondation Louis Vuitton etc..."
"188863","85177","1","Get a room with a pool, its so hot and so wonderful to jump in after a long day exploring Siem Reap. We really enjoyed the cocktails at the bar, and have them get tickets for the circus."

"188919","85201","1","Never take a city view room as they are overlooking Pico, extremely noisy and smelly street with low level shops neon lights almost in front of your balcony. 
Beverly view gives you what you'd expect from Cipriani hotel, but they treat it as 2 or 3 upgrades from the standard level. Only for the view. The rest is the same.
Swimming pool outside of the hotel is small, not for swimming."
"188922","85202","1","Fantastic view from the infinity pool in the spa"

"188942","85211","1","Parking is a bit tricky. They directed me to a lot that as a few blocks away. Remove everything visible from your car when you park it. I did and my car was fine. Someone else had stuff in their car and it was broken into. Be safe! "
"188945","85212","1","Book a garden suite if you want a bit more quiet. "
"188948","85213","1","Not a great location. You can do way better"
"188951","85214","1","At first I was a skeptical as I had just come from the Fairmont Waterfront with a beautiful view of the water and a high focus on service. Although The Burrard is not a service oriented hotel in the same manner they offered nice touches such as candy in my room, bottled water, a green focus and free calls to anyway in North America. And free WiFI. I would say that it is a Boutique Motel as opposed to your typical Table Boutique Hotel. "

"188991","85230","1","The wifi seemed to work better on the lower floors. Some rooms did not have a full balcony which may have been nice. Ours had a terrace but it was more of a window that opened. The view was spectacular towards the cathedral but the road noise was loud and the bar was directly above us so a little noisy. "

"189185","85313","1","The location would not be for everyone.  If you are interested in a unique, art-filled, quirky location with a very hands-on staff, this is it.  It doesn't hurt that it is in the center of historic Rome."

"189229","85331","1","There is not a whole lot to do, so prepare to relax and entertain yourself at this quiet hotel. There's a fun jungle hike and the snorkeling/boat excursion is highly recommended. Kayaking is a nice option, but the hotel needs to update its fleet with some more stable models! 
The transfer to the hotel is at least 70 minutes by car plus 20 by boat. "

"189376","85392","1","We asked for a quieter room, and got one. But if you are sensitive to noise, I could see how being right on the main thoroughfare could bother you. Let the hotel know your preferences and they will accommodate you."

"189601","85485","1","Be aware that a queen bed is actually two twins pushed together - rooms come with beds separated. They do have a queen topper and it is actually comfortable. Rooms are small, quite pod-like. Bathroom is very tight but efficient. Probably not a long stay - good for three nights max, in my opinion."

"189882","85600","1","This is not a resort. The hotel is a transformed, vintage apartment building so fixtures aren't all new and it's all about character. And breakfast which you can only eat here if you're a guest. A very special place if its your thing."

The Tablet description of the hotel was not accurate - we went into all the room types - no view of Manhattan skyline unless you went on balcony and craned to look around the corner.  Also no mention that the hotel was in its VERY soft opening - drills at 8:00 AM and that was not clear at all on Tablet.  Tablet is unreliable."

"189976","85639","1","This hotel is a place to party and go to for a drink. 
It is not a place to stay unless you are out to party and just come back for a couple of hours of sleep.
It is more like like vegas meets hard rock hotel than a relaxing and calm hotel. Wherever you are in the hotel you must be in party mode. The Bar is loud but great for party. Service is good. Room are ok in terms of Deco although very contemporary and grey..... with not much of a window or light. Again more of a place to transit than to base yourself."

If you don't book a room with a view, make sure to take a yoga class. The yoga pavilion seems to be the only public space in the hotel with a view of the surrounding countryside. Slightly odd design . . . "

(there was a shuttle, but taking it was decidedly downmarket compared to the level of the hotel). The immediate neighborhood is not lovely, either. It was an army base, and still looks like one. Also the staff, except for the Spanish speakers, seemed to have their minds elsewhere. Finally, the US National Parks fee was a nasty surprise. "
"190938","86043","1","The breakfast is two eggs, bread, butter and yogurt.  You are the chef.  I would opt out and buy your own breakfast supplies or have breakfast around the corner."
"190941","86044","1","You can hear some noise from the street, but it was not a problem for us."
"190944","86045","1","It was so hard to select a hotel in Barcelona.  There are great choices!  I traveled with my 15-yr old son and he says this hotel is his favorite in the world. It was chic, smart, comfortable and perfectly located. We LOVED the great selection of snacks/soup/sweets/drinks all day, every day. "
"190981","86063","1","Don't stay here, not worth the price and also out of the way."
"190986","86065","1","Invest time in getting a suitable wine tour. "
"190995","86069","1","This is a cool hotel within 20 minute walk to Duomo location and lots of restaurants nearby with walking distance along the canal area. While not a traditional hotel, it is clean and has modern amenities. The common areas are unique and eclectic with a lot to look at. There are a bar and restaurant (not open Sunday) in the hotel. I would stay here again. "
"191002","86072","1","Ask for a higher floor..."
"191011","86076","1","There is no A/C. Usually not an issue but if you're going in summer could be rather warm. Try to get a room on upper floors (4/5). Lower floors are closer to street, can be noisy and less air circulation. "
"191020","86080","0","Plan to stay in the hotel & enjoy all the facilities at least for a few hours. Definitely check out the vault bar. The secret Ned locations guide is a lovely touch. "
"191027","86083","1","Das Hotel hat keine angenehmen öffentlichen Bereiche - eine kleine Lobby, einen Frühstücksraum im Jugendherbergsstil und nach dem Frühstück geschlossen, einen Pool ohne Restaurant und mit Gatter zum Parkplatz - nicht gemütlich."
"191032","86085","1","There aren't any elevators, so it's all stairs to your room- but the building is old old old Rome and sooo cool!"
"191039","86088","1","The location is great. Ask for a corner room or a room with a view. "
"191056","86096","1","Good reliable laundry service next door makes the hotel even more attractive.Just use your room no for contact details."
"191069","86102","1","She view is best"
"191072","86103","1","If you want anyone to be able to make calls to you in your room, you must give the hotel manager that instruction, or else your calls, even calls from colleagues, will be refused by reception. Weird, but apparently this is ""for your own protection"". I did not particularly wish to be protected from my clients and colleagues, this that's how this hotel works."
"191079","86106","1","Definitely grab a lunch at the restaurant, it was amazing."
"191094","86113","1","Every room restaurant, bar and shop within the hotel is exceptionally curated from the newest, trendiest and best Mexico City has to offer. Take time to enjoy what's been prepared for you!"
"191109","86120","1","Parking at the hotel is exorbitantly expensive, but street parking is pretty available."
"191114","86122","1","Tablet plus upgrade was thoughtful"
"191119","86124","1","Valet parking was $35/night. No self parking except for street"
"191122","86125","1","Ask for a room facing Ohio St. and higher up in the building if possible."
"191127","86127","1","The rooms are shabby and dated. The whole hotel could use a refresh. Front desk staff was less than helpful at all times. The system for getting hotel guests to the rooftop bar on busy nights is a nightmare. "
"191132","86129","1","Note that breakfast is not included in the price (or at least it wasn't for us). Also, breakfast is expensive and not particularly filling for what it is. I would recommend planning on eating elsewhere for breakfast or buying pastries ahead of time. There are some good places around there to eat for breakfast though--we liked California Bean."
"191135","86130","1","We were not warned about how charming the city was and wished we had planned to stay more than 2 nights - will definitely stay for longer on our return visit.

While our trip is not done yet, I already know this city and stay will be the highlight of Morocco."
"191138","86131","1","No lo recomiendo "
"191143","86133","1","I would recommend anyone in Sicily to base out of this hotel - where you can relax and rejuvenate.  Day trips to etna and Taormina are very doable - but you can have a peaceful experience amidst the hustle of Sicily. "
"191154","86138","1","Be clear about whether you want to be close to the action or not so close to the action. Use the valet (it's cheaper, faster and friendlier than parking yourself)."
"191157","86139","1","This is the kind of hotel where you're going to want to allocate a bit of time just to hang out at the hotel. it's wonderful! "
"191160","86140","1","It's divine. My absolute favorite hotel in Manhattan "

"191200","86158","1","Make sure you've checked out the exact location of the entrance and mapped your route down to the last detail before you leave home. Otherwise you'll be going round and round a series of one way roads blocked with construction vehicles. "
"191207","86161","1","Service is poor. Hotel is inflexible. Location is remote from town."
"191216","86165","1","Amazing value and very stylish—well worth staying at without hesitation. "
"191221","86167","1","Si buscan privacidad, buena comida, la mejor playa de la zona y un inmejorable servicio. este hotel es el indicado."
"191228","86170","1","The hotel is very much a *scene*. Lots of hipsters in the lobby and on the roof. If you need any peace and quiet, this is not your place."
"191235","86173","1","It's 5 mins from walk from the station (not the main line) but from the one where the CAT (airport train) terminates- so extra handy if you're coming from the airport without a car."
"191238","86174","1","NA"
"191243","86176","1","Do not expect concierge service of any kind. 
Ask to stay at the back of the hotel. They opened a bar across the street from the hotel which gets very noisy in the warmer months. There is no ventilation is the room or airco. There was nowhere to put your clothes in our room. 4 hangers on a rack."
"191250","86179","1","Do your own neighborhood research
Plan to save some time to enjoy the room"
"191253","86180","1","DO NOT STAY HERE! Very bad experience."

"191259","86182","1","beware of the size of the room.... choose a big room. "
"191274","86189","1","Stay for dinner.  Visit the cave onsite.  Take a dip in the pool."
"191283","86193","1","Bring some comfortable shoes to go for a walk in the surroundings.  There's a path leading up the hill into the woods.  And a good book, since this is a place to really relax and enjoy the silence.  No sounds of motorcars, just the occasional bark of a dog from the village."
"191290","86196","1","If there are any issues with the room, be sure to tell the staff immediately. We had an issue with the air conditioning not working properly. We tried sleeping with the windows open instead because it was late at night, but it was too loud on the street to get a good rest. The staff could have easily solved the problem, so it was our own fault for not speaking up. They were very helpful with other aspects of our stay. "
"191295","86198","1","If you can find someplace nearby for the same price or cheaper, take it. The service from the front desk was awful. From burnt out light bulbs to room service never showing up. It was not worth $200. "
"191298","86199","1","If you like the aera in Paris its a great hotel"
"191301","86200","1","Stay at the Crosby if you can"
"191304","86201","1","Love the location! Staff is there to assist"
"191307","86202","1","Great place to stay for young as well as those of us of a certain age.  Lots of energy and style. Do a little homework before you stay there and you can really get a lot out of even a short stay because it is convenient to everything."
"191314","86205","1","Explore Helsinki by bike ! Great experience !
Visit the Loyly Beach Club for a relaxed chill out session.
Best bar: Liberty or Death (5 min walking distance from the hotel)"
"191319","86207","1","WALK around. Soho south, Greenwich Village west, East side... east, up Fifth Avenue to shop... north. Marlton location is best in the city."
"191334","86214","1","This is a great spot to stay while exploring the North Bay area. So beautiful!"
"191339","86216","1","Great location
Great design
Great great pool and spa"
"191342","86217","1","Do not stay in this hotel. Worst customer service and appalling attitude. I left a lot of jewelry in the safety deposit box when I checked out as we were driving around Provence (as many people do holidaying around there) and the hotel DID NOT BOTHER to call or email me to let me know that I had left my items even after TWO DAYS. When I discovered my loss, I called them and they claimed to have not found my items and the staff refused to escalate to a manager or someone of higher authority. The front desk put down the phone on me 3 times because he had no idea or solution for me. I had to wait for the next shift of staff just to ask them to check again. When I did, they said they did find my items but did not have any reason why they didn't contact me. They were unapologetic about it and even cavalier about it when I said I was upset. I had to reschedule and shift all my travel plans just to drive back to the Hotel to pick up my things. I also had food poisoning in the restaurant on my first night. Never will I stay in this hotel again and I don't recommend it to anyone."
"191349","86220","1","Microscopic rooms. Felt like a jail with all the barred shutters and doors "
"191352","86221","1","go here for seeing The Ned and partying - not for a fantastic hotel service experience."

"191414","86247","1","You will not be disappointed. "
"191423","86251","1","The taxi driver from the airport could not locate the hotel. I had to call and have the hotel agent speak with the driver to provide directions. The property is situated on a side lane which is often gated. However, there is access off of the main road, through a door and into the courtyard. On Google, it appears as Grace Hotel or Yi House."

"191442","86258","1","Hotel de clase, muy bien ubicado y con un servicio impecable"
"191449","86261","1","The parking cost is high, but everything about this hotel is excellent. You might need to ask them to increase the air conditioning power for your room, but the rooms are sleek and the location is excellent. Don't miss the view from the rooftop terrace! Booking through a tablet got us great rooms and service!"
"191452","86262","1","Research restaurants in Stresa. There are some gems. Pool is great for relaxing, but ""grotto"" spa area is uncomfortably warm--looks nice but no one seemed able to use it. Rooms are small but beautiful--with Etro robes and slippers! "

"191470","86269","1","Don't bring a car parking is high"
"191473","86270","1","Take advantage of their local car service. It's super convenient, especially if you want to go to the Getty Center (free but they charge for parking). Also, breakfast at the restaurant (West) is quite tasty and the views are sensational. Hotel prices, obv."

"191602","86323","1","Due to loud street noise and old elevators - best to get a room on a high floor and far away from the elevators."
"191605","86324","1","This hotel is so far out of the main area of town.  If you're looking to do much walking or to spend time in the old city I do not recommend it."

"191616","86328","1","Rooms facing the street are very noisy. Be sure to ask for a room facing the rear coutryard. This hotel is only recommnendable for those who are mainly interested in the common areas of a hotel and who care little for the room quality."

"191817","86409","1","L'hôtel n'est pas en bord de mer, nous avons finalement décidé de ne pas prendre de voiture car nous aimons marcher. On met 30 minutes à pied jusqu'à Caleta un joli petit village de pêcheurs juste en dessous de l'hôtel en bord de mer et ensuite vous pouvez marcher de longs kilomètres sur le paséo avec boutiques et restaurants à foison. Si vous êtes paresseux, pour remonter il est facile de trouver un taxi pour moins de 4 EUR depuis Caleta. Il faut compter environ 30 EUR de taxi depuis l'aéroport.
"
"191820","86410","1","Don't expect a palatial room. It's NYC, after all. The beds are high enough to store your suitcase underneath. The keys are clunky, so feel free to leave the key with the front desk if you're worried about it taking up too much space in your pocket or you just dont want to carry it around."
"191825","86412","1","Stay here if you want to stay at a very trendy and young hotel. If you prefer something with a bit more service, this isn't a fit."

"191831","86414","1","Be sure to have a drink at the very chic art deco inspired bar and eat at the marvelous Jean-George PUMP Room. Then enjoy a 15 minute stroll along the lake front down to the world class boutiques on Oak Street. "

"191926","86455","1","My room was kind of spartan. But, it was perfect for me. It is a bit on the edge of the city. But, the public transport is excellent from the hotel and the hotel has bikes and Vespas to rent. Also, Vienna is very easy to walk. In short, it is not centrally located. Yet, that is not a big deal. "
"191931","86457","1","It's a very cozy hotel.  I was there on vacation with my nephews, and it was just a perfect hotel for the occasion.  Price was very reasonable (usually when I go to Amsterdam for business I probably pay twice as much) , the service was excellent, and location was great as well.  "

"192024","86497","1","This is a perfect location, right on the water. About 8-10 great restaurants within blocks, Boulevard is across the street. One of the best restaurants in town.  Easy to eat at the bar if you don't have reservations. "
"192029","86499","1","The water pressure is low and the hotel needs to be refurbished/freshened up as it appears dated and some elements don't work or are broken."
"192038","86503","1","Check out the size of your room, my room although very nice was tiny and the bathroom had a shower enclosure.  No place to put your toiletries, too expensive for what I received."
"192045","86506","1","The Breakfast on the seventh floor is worth the price.!"
"192052","86509","1","It gets busy and the downstairs areas can get loud so ensure you are on upper floors if you need some rest and relaxation. But the vibe and energy is one of the hotels charms so come with the right mindset and enjoy the environ."

"192154","86553","1","Great service and pool - perfect for a stopover but probably not the main destination for a holiday. "
"192161","86556","1","Although a family owned resort, don't expect the service (or the owners walking about) to provide that familial welcome - this is more of a branded (from the towels to the soap) experience but great if here just to take time out and explore this part of Puglia. "
"192166","86558","1","Hit High Nelly's around the corner for a solid Irish breakfast and Searson's around the other corner for a perfect neighborhood pub."

"192410","86660","1","If you need to access the internet in your room, it is not reliable. The location is fantastic, but you constantly hear sounds in the room of people walking by, etc. "

"192442","86674","1","they will send you to Equinox for a $25 uncharge.  It is worth it."
"192445","86675","1","Always ask for a room away from the elevators, they are very noisy in the rooms near by. A room with a harbor view is a pleasant bonus."

"192473","86688","1","LA Downtown is still an up and coming area.  There are homeless people on the streets and lots of building work underway so don't expect Beverly Hills!"
"192486","86694","1","Rooms are nicely appointed but small, more of a business type style. Outdoors can be noisy so windows need to stay closed. Staff was helpful while not obtrusive, food was excellent. The stay a little pricey for actual hotel amenities available. Room was kept very clean but beds were not the most comfortable. Convenient, nice rooms & staff, not quite luxurious."

"192525","86710","1","As a Tablet Plus member our stay included some great perks making it amazing value for money (especially for central London). Worth joining! "
"192532","86713","1","La salle de petit déjeuner est très exigu et l'ambiance pas trop sympathique. Prenez le plutôt dans la chambre."
"192545","86719","1","This hotel is closely located to the Fisherman's Wharf and the piers but that brings with it clientele unlike normal Tablet clients. The entire hotel, exterior/lobby/rooms, is grungy and kitschy, from the silly ""sharks in the portholes"" to the goofy nautical theme. The rooms feel dirty as though they need a deep cleaning. I would NOT recommend Hotel Zephyr to other Tablet PLUS users. "
"192548","86720","1","Try to reserve a room well in advance as rooms book fast in this hotel."

"192620","86751","1","Be aware this is off the beaten track."
"192623","86752","1","Don't bother with the Baths.  They are a bit weird.  I had been to Budapest 20 years ago and the feeling was the same then too."
"192626","86753","1","Arrange in advance for the restricted vehicular access."
"192629","86754","1","The spa is a hidden secret.  You can use the indoor pool for no charge."
"192638","86758","1","Don't be put off by the location away from the lake. Arco is an incredibly charismatic and romantic little town. Way better than staying with all the tourists in Riva del Garda. Explore the old castle and the olive groves behind it, eat at the incredible restaurant tucked between buildings near the church! "
"192641","86759","1","Be aware this is a small hotel and you access the elevator to your rooms through the common area (bar/breakfast room) - a less formal style than some might be use to.  There is street noise but not overwhelming. "

"192653","86764","1","Perfect place to stay."
"192662","86768","1","Room 1506 had the most amazing view of the Empire State Building!"
"192665","86769","1","Room 14 for normal room is outstanding.  Our daughters stayed in that one.  We had 32 top floor with balcony .  Very romantic. Restaurant was also one of our favourites."
"192668","86770","1","Overall this hotel feels very average in terms of general ""classiness"" compared to similarly priced hotels on Tablet at South Beach.  For example, the rooms just feel like they lack a general quality of finish."
"192673","86772","1","You can use this as a base to explore Avignon and Provence but it's so pretty you may wind up just staying in."
"192678","86774","1","Great hotel!"
"192681","86775","1","Peçam dicas para a Luisa!

"192768","86811","1","Rooms 16 and 18 are incredible."
"192773","86813","1","Es ist davon abzuraten, in einem anderen als dem Buffetrestaurant zu essen. Die sogenannten à la carte Restaurants sind deutlich schlechter."
"192776","86814","1","Recomendable absolutamente. La estancia se hace inolvidable."
"192783","86817","1","Try and get an upstairs room with a balcony overlooking the garden which is a botanical dream! Sip on a mint julep and you're in a Hemingway novel!"
"192786","86818","1","Go to the bar - it's very art deco and worth trying out."

"192813","86830","1","Certo hotel piacevole e pulito "
"192816","86831","1","It's a nice modern room in a great location. Very artistic and fancy. But the hotel offers minimal services, more of do it yourself kind of place. "
"192827","86836","1","Like no other.  Not fancy at all, but very, very chill."
"192832","86838","1","Breakfast was a highlight-- make sure it is included. "
"192839","86841","1","Fitness center is quite far... Also such great food options all around, would skip their breakfast."
"192842","86842","1","The rooms are dark but amazing."
"192845","86843","1","Choose a room facing Mercer street"
"192850","86845","1","Beware that some rooms are directly on the train line and one can hear the sounds and vibrations of trains every few minutes, even over night. 

"
"192855","86847","1","Sadly, not located in the safest area at night. Wouldn't recommend walking back to the hotel alone"
"192858","86848","1","Loved the classically Paris tiny square the hotel looks out on - BUT - I'm glad I'm a regular Paris visitor the main street surrounding the hotel has a very very bad case of the ladies of the night....and those who love them - bloody annoying- not the hotels fault at all but I will keep this in mind next time I book "
"192869","86853","1","je déconseille cet hôtel, faussement branché, mal placé et au personnel peu présent."
"192880","86858","1","Must rent bikes as soon as you arrive.
Go for the larger ""designer"" rooms. They are spacious and incredibly designed. Bring snacks if you tend to use mini bars - there isn't one nor is there a decent cafe. Bring earplugs in case of loud neighbors."
"192883","86859","1","Eat at the restaurant, as well!  It's a big part of the experience!  Ask for Jennifer.  She's fun and very knowledgeable. "
"192894","86864","1","Be prepared to walk! "
"192897","86865","1","Avoid. One of the worst places we've stayed through Tablet. "
"192900","86866","1","This location is secluded. My stay was perfect in every way. Wonderful, attentive staff. Jaw-dropping views. I appreciated the technology in the rooms like built-in bluetooth speakers and easy connection to my Netflix account. A great respite after a day of tourism.  Or split your stay between this tranquil setting and the beach area."
"192903","86867","1","Must try the restaurant, it's amazing with an impressive wine list."

"192965","86893","1","Calmer then the sister-hotel next door. Good restaurant and excellent service. No jaded personel. "
"192968","86894","1","This is a quite place, the rooms are dark with no TV, guests below the age of 21 are not allowed. The hotel is luxurious in it's simplicity and all of the above only add to the experience, not the opposite. We fell in love with Sparrows and will definitely be back!"
"192981","86900","1","Ask about the hotel's Art Walks. They are complimentary to hotel guests! And book the hotel's rooftop jacuzzi in advance of your stay. It's a special treat after a long day."

"192991","86904","1","Wine and beer are free from the minibar. And I am talking full-size bottles of wine from Austria's best vintners! You can even take a bottle down with you to the hotel's restaurant to have with your dinner, sans corkage fee. :-)"

"193000","86907","1","Beautiful place!"
"193009","86911","1","This place really is for the upper crust. If you are more into backpack / DIY style travelling, this ain't for you. It's very old school, which we enjoyed, but we could understand it's not for everyone. "
"193012","86912","1","Not for walkers. You will need to drive for everything."
"193025","86918","1","When looking for the entrance: it is the first gate on the left backing from the stone arch entrance of the biosphere nature reserve. "
"193034","86922","1","Allow extra time to enjoy this lovely place.  Absolutely Perfect!"
"193041","86925","1","Have a cocktail, they are great. Bar nibbles also good"
"193044","86926","1","Get a room that has the A/C facing the bedroom. Some of the smaller rooms have the A/C facing a  wall which does not help you sleep when it's 95 degrees at 3am. We called down to the front desk and they switched our rooms right away."
"193053","86930","1","This hotel isn't right in town but the design and serenity more than make up for the inconvenience... you won't want to leave the hotel!"

"193103","86951","1","Use the bar/ restaurant"
"193108","86953","1","Give as much information ahead of time in case you have dietary needs like gluten free, as they are very accommodating. Staff also made a really good recommendation for a Dinner restaurant (Burgli) that I would never have found that had an outdoor terrace facing the lake. "

"193259","87016","1","the ""wellness"" tag is slightly misleading. While the gym is excellent, the spa facilities are more style than function, and the restaurant serves the same food you'll get anywhere, although there is a juice bar in the gym      "

"194423","87499","1","Due to an early flight we picked this hotel for the location. Which was a major bonus. Overall I was disappointed in the hotel. I've stayed at many Kimptons and was surprised this was part of the company. Hotel rooms were OK, but definitely seemed to be put together quickly. Not dirty, but didn't feel comfortable like most Kimptons. Beds were not comfortable, bathtub faucet was weirdly hard to work, etc. location is not ideal unless you want quick access to airport. Staff was super friendly! Just didn't feel worth the price. "

"194456","87512","1","If you want to hit museum mile and can afford it splurge on the Mark instead. If price is the deciding factor and you want to be near the park this is fine but set your expectations low and avoid feeling underwhelmed."

"194552","87552","1","I didn't realise that Puglia was so spread out and actually there was not much to do without driving at least an hour to surrounding towns. There aren't loads of beaches to visit or things to do close by. Plan to enjoy the Borgo and everything it has to offer otherwise you will be in the car everyday driving to see the sights. 
Book one of the festivities in the Piazza. We did the end of summer party which had long tables decorated with vines and candle lights. There was music and dancing and different food stations to taste all the local cuisine. We really enjoyed it.

"194919","87703","1","just a reminder if you don’t often dish out a little more money for a nicer hotel than the trendy “boutique” type options...you will pay more at every turn then you might expect. $50 a day valet, not optional it’s the only parking. $24 breakfast? $42 before tip for misc service charges. atm? $200 max at a time $4 a pop. 2 rounds of drinks with you and your date? jameson and gingerale? great! but they only carry the higher end jameson (yes it exsists). $96 before tip. That’s not meant negatively but more transparently. I am trying to share information some may find useful when booking. 

last thing, rooms are very very small. And i had the largest suite, 10th floor, in the corner. the presidential is the only upgrade left on the list lol. "
"194922","87704","1","Wait for the renovation to be over. Maybe there will be improvements. Don't stay in the older part of the hotel, stay in the Casa area as that is what is mostly advertised and very different from the older part of the hotel which are very plain rooms. "

"194979","87728","1","As advertised this is more of an upscale guest house than a hotel. Common areas are practically non-existent. I never saw an employee seated at the reception area. This type of property may work for some guests and not for others. 
I did not receive the Tablet Plus upgrade. In fact from looking at the room pictures on the website, I was obviously given the smallest and least attrractive room of all. It looked like more of a ""downgrade"" than the hoped-for Tablet Plus upgrade. I did receive however the Tablet Plus benefit of fruit plate an bottle of Prosecco."

"195153","87798","1","Beware the ""suite"" in the annex building, which is really an apartment in an apartment building not an inconsequential distance from the hotel.

"195403","87900","1","It is extremely helpful for the riad to know when you will be arriving. Have the curtesy to let them know your arrival time. They are attentive and want to insure you arrived safely and getting you settled. They are waiting to receive their guests so give them a heads up.  I highly recommend letting the riad arrange car service if you are arriving by plane. It makes things easier for you and for them. Like most places in the heart of Marrakech,  the riad could be challenging to find until you're familiar with your surroundings.

"195450","87919","1","Do not book. It is expensive and it is not worth the cost."

"195460","87923","1","It is very confusing figuring out how to get in. We walked around a lot the first time we arrived as we couldn't figure it out. If you're on the upper raised walkway of the Shiodome area, there's an escalator that takes you down one level to the ""reception""-- you then go in an elevator to an upper level lobby/check in.

This hotel isn't as centrally located as some, but we did like our stay here as the rooms were very comfortable and it wasn't too far from the subway."
"195467","87926","1","Hotel is in a very quiet setting, with very little around it, which can be a good or bad thing.  The hotel was extremely sleepy and chill. "

"195488","87934","1","It is a new hotel, so its style, location, and cleanness is in very good status. I highly recommend this hotel especially to couple, friends, and family, but without children."
"195497","87938","1","leave shutters open a little if you want to wake up in the am. Closed, and the room becomes a fabulous cocoon! We chose this hotel in order to go to Il Duomo (ciccio sultan's 2 star restaurant in Ragusa) - which I also highly recommend. "

"195648","88003","1","The deluxe room is a great size for one person with above average luggage.  Two people with big bags would be cramped.  No real place to store your bags.
Know that one side of the hotel is located directly across the street from an elementary school, so if you want to sleep in, ask for a room on the other side."
"195653","88005","1","The rooms are individually decorated and can vary in atmosphere.  We were disappointed in our first room as it was on a low floor, decorated in dark colors and generally felt a bit depressing.  There were no other rooms available the first night but they moved us the next day to a room we loved.  "

"195703","88026","1","Stay elsewhere. This hotel is worn and has seen it's best days. Needs an upgrade desperately. Not sure what the appeal of a sliding bathroom door with a 1 inch space between the wall and door is, but it's a design trend that needs to go away. If you actually like privacy while using the bathroom, this hotel is not for you. "

"195855","88091","1","The towns around aren't really that interesting, driving is super challenging, and taxis are super expensive, so... it's really a place to go to and stay in my view.  As wonderful as it was, three days was enough for me."

"195864","88094","1","Heed the explanation of how the tips work, they repeat the message for you several times on cards in your room. It makes things less awkward."
"195869","88096","1","Rooms are small, euro small. I got a tablet upgrade and was a bit surprised. But they are smartly designed.  Adequate for a single but there would be some navigating with just two staying in the smaller rooms. "

"195885","88103","1","I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel but I would not think those who are sensitive to freeway noise would be able to tolerate it. The hotel is literally next to the 405.  It did not bother me. "

"195936","88125","1","Embrace the bus. It will get you easily to Nakameguro and Meguro stations without much of a walk. "
"195939","88126","1","the main street side could be slightly noisy, as there is a night club on the street level.    however, the hotel provided earplugs, and if you are out late anyway, it probably coincides with your schedule.   this nightclub was a minor inconvenience, overshadowed by the all around great experience provided by the hotel."

"196025","88162","1","If you can't get a room at The Ham Yard, which you must do your very best to do, then as an alternative, book one of their other Hotels. Tim and Kit Kemp are geniuses and it shows. Currently, I am writing this review from their Haymarket Hotel which is also excellent. "
"196030","88164","1","Def eat in the restaurant.  I don't normally say that to people, but this place (and the sister property Zetta) both have awesome restaurants on the ground floor run by independent operators.

I want a pink room with a bathtub) and they will do everything they can to accommodate. I only learned this when I was checking out, but still.. a brilliant tip for next time! "
"196302","88279","1","As with most riads, the rooms look into the open air courtyard. If you are a light sleeper it can be a little loud, especially in the morning if guests are eating breakfast. "
"196305","88280","0","There are so many amazing riads in the city. This one is perfect for 1-2 nights and I highly recommend the blue apartment if staying - it is a feast for the eyes. If you are looking for extremely attentive service, or are staying for a longer period of time, there are others in the city that might be a better choice. "

"196320","88286","1","I pretty much think they could have upgraded this but hold first Viceroy brand frequent visitors first.  Almost all the Tablet Plus reservations in the past has yielded in an uggrade for me.  Disappointed. Plus Tablet Plus confirmed that the hotel was expecting me early - yet the amenities had not been put in the room until I called the Front Desk.  Did NOT feel anticipated in the least.  BUT - the Rambler restaurant proved excellent - food and service all terrific.  It was the only redeeming factor of the stay. "
"196329","88290","0","A room overlooking the square would be preferable."
"196332","88291","1","I was traveling for business and booked a room based on availability (all hotels packed) - a bunk bed room. As a business traveler I would not recommend this room type; small/uncomfortable bed, no desk space/closet, small space and almost no in-room amenities. I would stay at the hotel again but only in a king standard room type."
"196335","88292","1","je conseillerais cet hôtel à des amis compte tenu de sa situation  et de son accueil.
et du très bon service "
"196338","88293","1","Good match if you're a budget-conscious tourist with minimal interaction with the hotel. If you're a business traveler, and use hotel services, then hopefully the great public spaces, location, and price make up for exceptionally poor service."

"196488","88354","1","This place is fun and funky.  We were there the weekend before Halloween, so hot spot for 20-30 crowd.  Our room (single) was quite small and the tiny shower fits a small person no larger than size 6 women's.  Not sure a man could use it."
"196497","88358","1","The hotel is part of a little village of sorts called ""The Pearl"" with various shops, etc. and a Farmers' Market on both Sat/Sun.  -  The Rio Go water taxi stops at the hotel and takes you right into San Antonio; its a bit pricey at $18 but you can reuse the ticket all day."
"196500","88359","1","I have no tips. "
"196507","88362","1","Perhaps what we didn't do was speak to the staff / concierge enough to find that they had accessible to knowledge that would have made out time in Venice that much more special.  In the end, the one thing we did ask about was Murano.  We got there & back in a complimentary water taxi, which was nice.  I think we should have take the water taxi to the factory with whom the hotel has a relationship and then planned lunch and our own way back.  Maybe there were more bits a that we missed."
"196510","88363","1","There are no real common areas. We were happy to wander out for breakfast but if you need a hotel with a catering option, this is not for you. On the other hand, the room was great, the bed comfortable and the area lively. "

No basic amenities in room such as a complimentary bottle of water (water in room smells of sulfur and old pipes), no magazines or info about the city.

"196594","88399","1","So this was more of an apartment vs a traditional hotel. It's located in a mixed-use building so don't expect the typical hotel lobby greeting and exterior, but the concierge was awesome. The apartments are on the top floor with a phenomenal view and great location for walking anywhere in the city. The rooms are very private and we never saw or heard anyone else staying close by. Since this is a city apartment, don't expect daily linen service unless you specifically ask for it."
"196599","88401","1","Buildings are in separate locations and quite a distance from each other. Also, used ironing board and hair dryer which caused the power to go out. Bathroom was next to the patio were they held various events. We weren’t warned about that. "

The Vibe room is not as spacious as it looks. "
"196682","88433","1","We love the rooms overlooking the mews. Splurge on a higher room class -- the Superior Four Posters are great and the suites even better. Definitely get a drink at Seymour's. We didn't have afternoon tea but we saw others having it and it looked delicious."
"196687","88435","1","Ask for a orthopedic mattress if available "
"196692","88437","1","The rooms are very basic and not renovated but the bed is clean and comfortable, and our room on the third floor facing the back was very quiet for New York. The location near Central Park is great if you need to be in that area and the price for this central location is quite reasonable. It’s an adequate stay for one night, not longer. "

"196815","88491","1","This is overall a cute hotel, but it would be a three stars at best. It looks like a designer budget hotel, but it wasn't all that budget when I was there.  Definitely better than the Marriott where my colleagues stayed, but definitely this is an unusual hotel with some quirks  "
"196818","88492","1","Plan to eat out or order delivery because the restaurant is open from 7am to 11:30am and doesn't reopen until 5:30, and the rooftop bar doesnt open until 3pm. BUT there are a lot of great snacks and a full minibar in the room so you won't starve. It was a fun and funky atmosphere though, I definitely want to go back."

"197037","88583","1","I enjoyed staying there!"
"197040","88584","1","Do not miss the 'Estate Walk' taking in the entire property - a must! The entire resort is broken down into several individual villas - of which each of the room/suite categories exist along with a shared communal area within each compound. The idea being you can book an entire villa (all themed differently based on the elements) - or simply to stay in one room/suite in a shared villa. (Very much like a riad in Morocco) There are also two private small villas which we stayed in one of that was quite modern and just beautiful. "

"197061","88593","1","Great hotel!"
"197076","88600","1","While the hotel is a little bit isolated, not super close to the metro system, it's not too far either. About a 10-15 min walk to the Toyoko/Tokyu line (which is 3 stops from Shibuya) or a 10 minute bus ride to the Meguro stop on the Yamanote line. There is also a really nice coffee shop right next door called Labo that I would recommend. Opens at 9am. It's a good spot for a light breakfast."
"197091","88607","1","Parking is horrendous around the hotel! Either pay $36 a day for valet or suggest Uber or Lyft!"
"197096","88609","1","The hotel is divided between a main level and upper level with pool. The short but ""too steep to walk"" distance between is a drawback because you need to hail a golfcart. If this matters you should be clear. But the size of the suites in the upper level and proximity to pool and gym was a big plus for me."
"197107","88614","1","For this price you can get better deals in town."
"197110","88615","1","There are much better hotels available in Kyoto."
"197115","88617","1","The rooms are charming.  This section of the Marais is residential and loaded with galleries and great restaurants - easily walkable to two different metro lines. Feels more authentically Parisian and without hordes of tourists on the streets.  "
"197118","88618","1","Make sure to take advantage of the terrace -- great place to relax or read in the afternoons or evening, even if the bar isn't open."
"197121","88619","1","This must be the best place in Boracay. Very quiet and away from the crowds. They also arrange the pick up from the airport and you avoid to drive 1 hour to cross the island. "
"197128","88622","1","Such a great little hotel , excellent location for museums and shops but on a quiet section of street diagonally opposite the Albertina. Loved the Conran designed rooms .

"197183","88645","1","We were told there was a local hangout just outside the gate. We didn't realize it until our last day. If you want to see a bit more of the island, rent your own car for adventures. The fancy beach they took us to was great, but we would've enjoyed a bit more flexibility than we had without a car."

The weather in November on this part of Bali isn't great - the sky was consistently pretty grey even when the sun did break through.

The pool is stunning but that means everyone is taking selfies there.

It's not as peaceful as an Aman resort due to the higher number of rooms."

"197574","88808","1","For the two days we were guests, we were the only non-Japanese visitors. While the staff is exceedingly friendly and communicates reasonably well in English, be aware that the interactions are not always easy. Also, this is a bit of an outlier for Tablet Hotels: the decor is not hip, trendy or cutting edge, but it does provide a true sense of staying in a traditional Japanese ryokan, but with that extra level of service and comfort one expects from a Tablet Hotel."
"197577","88809","1","While we didn't try the high-end French-inspired restaurant, the lobby bar/restaurant was uninspiring and a bit pricey....after your 14-hour flight you may be tempted to just eat in, but do yourself a favor and get out into the city."
"197580","88810","1","Upgrade one notch from cheapest rooms."
"197585","88812","1","So close to the Metro. Catch it direct from the airport and the station is about 50m from the hotel. Pack a swimming costume and use the pool and spa.

"197676","88849","1","Spring for the med/larger garden terrace rooms, or bathtub options. Can feel a bit cramped or be a bit dodgy otherwise. TOP TIP: the bay view suite is AMAZING. The photos and description on tablet do it no justice. (I am comparing it to other 1k/night suites in Miami Beach.)"

Today I am coming back and very excited about what’s my new room - all room has different style .

Great location, great idea of design, love the place "
"197896","88939","1","Despite all the nice experience the hotel was pretty empty when we were there, which gave a not of odd feeling that we were in an deserted place.

there is ALOT ALOT of construction next to the hotel. Very disappointing! They really need to give all guest ear plugs in the rooms. We stayed in a room and was upgraded but then its was freezing and overlooked the construction. We were moved but then the noise level from the bar and the trucks from construction was so load! I did not sleep at all."

"198397","89147","1","If you are weary from the hills, get a transit pass so you can hop onto the Santa Justa tram a few steps from the front door."
"198400","89148","1","Honestly, the layout felt less-than-secure. The quality of the doors, locks, etc., and the physical layout (room opened like a motel to a walkway). The hotel was warm (in the winter!) with no a/c and the only openable window was to the hotel exterior walkway, which was a no-go for safety reasons. If I had to go back, I'd probably find another hotel unless this was the only thing in the price range."
"198407","89151","1","This ended up being perfect for combining business and pleasure.   The village is so fun for dining and shopping, and it was dead easy to take the FM line a few stops direct to Rockefeller Center and business district."

"198450","89168","1","Find out in advance if your river view room is on the ground floor; if so you probably aren’t going to want to open the heavy curtains unless you don’t mind constant pedestrian traffic right next to the floor to ceiling windows. Hotel would have done well to have built in privacy screens or mirroring to give guests in these rooms greater privacy. 

Sound insulation from lobby or bar was not great meaning there was some bass nose coming into the room when I checked in, in the early evening. However this had disappeared by the time I returned to the room at 10:30 pm"

"198568","89215","1","This hotel is in an area with quite a bit of traffic. Allow a little extra time to get places, especially in the afternoon."
"198571","89216","1","Ask for a higher floor for a better view. Definitely check out the movie library in the welcome book and get a DVD from the front desk—great selection! 

Chelsea market is across the street, which is amazing. Grab a dinner to go (we got the size Goff zaatar chicken dinner—whole roast chicken and middle eastern sides made to order—delicious) and a bottle of wine and enjoy your room’s table for two next to the porthole window looking out at the city lights.

If you're looking for a romantic stay, be aware that this room does not offer normal privacy. Since it is on the first floor and faces inward, it also does not receive sunlight. We did not see the other rooms, but it would be wise to explore their possible shortcomings. Also note that the hotel is located at the end of a series of winding, gritty, narrow alleyways, so you need to use the phone they give you to call a staff member to pick you up at the taxi stand and lead you back to the hotel by foot whenever you go out. This process and the walk itself are not as glorious or charming as the Tablet review makes them sound. That said, the staff was very reliable and always there when we needed them to meet us."

The medina is pretty confusing and finding the riad on your own the first time could be difficult.   Once you are there, Romaine provides a map (and some wonderful hand drawn maps as well) and you will get the hang of it! 

Morocco is a developing nation, so the streets within the medina are not always clean and often are made of dirt.  When getting to the riad you will have to travel through these streets.  If you aren't very adventurous, you might want to stay at a bigger hotel outside of the medina. "

I had a room that was at street level so I could clearly hear people arguing and such outside of my window.  The room was also meters from the trolley tracks which would rumble from time to time.  I live in the city and was only there for a night, so this wasn't a big issue for me, but I would request a higher level away from the tracks.  I would not stay here again."

Plenty of room to walk around, just not that roomy that’s all.

"199874","89756","1","If you want to walk around old Zurich this is not your hotel. But if you want to experience how the old industrial part of the city has transformed into a creative hub and how other parts, such as the exact location of the hotel, has become entirely transformed - this is a very interesting location."
"199881","89759","1","Attention, les chambres sont très sombres mais bien insonorisées. Il n’y a pas de fenêtre à proprement parler car seule la porte de la chambre fait office de fenêtre.

Our four year old slipped and fell on her backside luckily not injuring herself too much (just a bruise) and she was walking next to me at the time. The pool did have yellow signs saying floor was slippery but kids ignore the signs if they can read and/or overly excited. Saw a number of kids slip and fall."

"200054","89832","1","Be aware the fee for parking."
"200061","89835","1","Wifi is completely hopeless in the room. I have not tried at the lobby. They do not seem to have a proper lobby as such as the seating area is part of the restaurant so I expect they will want you to order drinks by sitting there"

"200091","89846","1","Others have commented on noise. This is true and it's from construction of the restaurant on the first floor. It is only during the day and shouldn't be an issue once completed.

"200174","89882","1","This was perfect for small group in town for work conference. Boutique, fun retreat after a day at nearby big-box-conference-center type hotel. The courtyard! The clawfoot tub. The service!"
"200179","89884","1","It is far from the city as I know it so you are a bit secluded on the west side.  I would probably not stay here again due to the lack of room service or a real restaurant and bar but it was a nice pleasant stay and a clean room."

"200230","89906","1","Avoid the rooms ending in 17 - they are right next to the lift. "
"200233","89907","1","Nomad is a great neighborhood. This is one of the better spots I’ve stayed at (for the price) in this area. Much better than the Ace."
"200236","89908","1","Only thing is it is a slight walk to the closest tube location so we paid a little more in ubers and taxis. Not a big deal since there is so much to do right there in Kensignton."
"200239","89909","1","Bring water shoes for the hot springs - you can enter the water anywhere in the river and some spots are rocky. "
"200242","89910","1","Enjoy happy hour by the fire in the lounge."
"200257","89917","1","Keep in mind there is a restaurant bar that can be open late. "
"200260","89918","1","In a city and neighborhood as rich and lively as Condesa in DF this is akin to staying in a Starbucks.  There is a Starbucks in the lobby and it's a modern clean uninspired place.  Nice sheets.  Ikea-ish furniture and small fake Rothkos.  If you think Mexico City might be overwhelming for you then stay here.  You'll be back in generic contemporary culture in a flash."
"200263","89919","1","If you are looking for a place to stay on your honeymoon, look no further than this resort. Everywhere we turned, romance was in the air!"
"200266","89920","1","Splurge for a hilltop villa. You feel like you have your own house on a hill, that is how private it is. Add a plunge pool and a view of sunset, and it is heaven."
"200271","89922","1","Take advantage of that jetlag, and get up in time for sunrise and coffee along the river at the hotel's River Cafe. Watch the first rays appear and the river start to come to life."

"200285","89928","1","Lots of small neighbourhood cafes and restaurants. 
Good location for public transport in all directions. "
"200292","89931","1","Don’t Go, except maybe to the pool"
"200295","89932","1","Be wary of the room size. Our room was uncomfortably small, and the bathroom even more so.

Serviced our room at 6:00 pm when we were trying to shower and get ready to go out for the evening. We were gone all day and they service our room at 6:00 pm?

Evening Concierge was unfriendly and not the least bit interested in doing her job or being helpful. "
"200300","89934","1","We stayed with our 3 year old but supposedly Amsterdam doesn't allow more than 2 people to share a room for fire safety reason, even if one of those people is child. Nightmare for parents travelling with one child. Bear that in mind and confirm with hotel before booking."
"200305","89936","1","Bring binoculars. Right on the grounds are fantastic birds. Tons of them. "
"200318","89942","1","Try tripadvisor to book a tour guide for Matera, rather than relying on the hotel tour guide who meant well but was very scattered in story telling. "
"200331","89948","1","Most of the rooms are up a fairly steep hill. It can rain at times and though umbrellas are provided it would be s very good idea to bring a waterproof jacket and warm sweater. "

"200347","89955","1","the bazar across the corner and behind the jotel is nice and at the end of it a great restaurant "
"200350","89956","1","There are very steep stairs to some of the guest rooms and to the rooftop dining area. For guests who struggle with stairs, you may require a bottom floor room. Also, don't forget to take advantage of the Moroccan tea offered."
"200353","89957","1","Great family hotel. There is a outdoor kids activity park approximately 5 mins walk with a rubberized surface, very clean and great for children under 12. "

"200404","89978","1"," Have breakfast in bed.. it was divine"
"200411","89981","1","Don't bring a car if you don't have to due to the difficulty in parking and driving around the hotel. The spa is just a tiny room with a machine on the wall which produces steam, so don't get too excited. "
"200414","89982","1","Fun place in a good location.  "
"200427","89988","1","Be aware that the pool is in the center of the property and all the rooms face on to it - some quite close. If you have a ground floor room in a two-story part of the property, as we did, noise from above can be disruptive."
"200430","89989","1","Earplugs! The walls are crazy thin. Truthfully, we heard each adjacent room (above and next to us) engaged in...adult activities. "
"200435","89991","1","Get the corner room suite on a higher floor, not much view of anything except the train below, but offers more space and natural light.  Also impossible to get drinking water in the room."
"200444","89995","1","The pool area is mosquito-y but there's not much the hotel can do about that. "
"200447","89996","1","Subway systems, while not as wide ranging and fast as Tokyo, nevertheless gets you around town well and this hotel is right at the steps of a station making the need for a cab much less."

"200530","90034","1","If you have luggage, enter via the side street - don't carry your luggage up those crazy stairs."
"200533","90035","1","Be prepared for some noise. My room was under the bar, so I could hear chairs being moved around. Once I put my ear plugs in, I was fine, but it is a city hotel, so come prepared."
"200556","90046","1","The pisco tasting was a great way to spend the afternoon and the staff has great restaurant recommendations. "
"200559","90047","1","Use the concierge services for reservations and tips in the neighborhood.  Ask any employee for information, the young women showing me my room recommended a great ramen restaurant."

"200591","90060","1","Get a cottage, it's worth it to be able to walk right over to the pool from your room."

"200670","90094","1","The hotel had two erroneous charges on my bill - one of which was the minibar usage which was to have a $25 credit. Always a pet peeve! Also, the ""free bottle of wine"" wasn't a full sized bottle."
"200675","90096","1","Cocktail bar and ‘twist’ restaurant on 23rd floor overlooking strip were fabulous. "

"200685","90100","1","Don’t skip breakfast - it was excellent."
"200688","90101","1","The 7th floor, where the single rooms are, is a little cheerless. Room #702, decorated with eviscerated stuffed animals, is creepy "
"200691","90102","1","Tip waiter at pool early, you never wait on anything."
"200698","90105","1","Don't come here if you're looking for a regular hotel. Think instead of a great airbnb with quirky features, an attached cafe and super management. A proper Berlin experience"
"200701","90106","1","Velvet Taco next door is delicious! And Maple & Ash is a great, trendy steakhouse around the corner. And the Fulton Market area has some of the city’s best restaurants! "
"200708","90109","1","Don't make an overseas phone call from your room.
2.5 minute phone call was 17 New Zealand dollars.
Now I know hotels make a bit of money on calls but this is extortion "
"200719","90114","1","Manatee Suite is under the breakfast area. Ok for us, but if you aren’t a early riser it might be annoying."
"200722","90115","1","Forget anything else in the area, or London for that matter.  Absolutely consistent over the years, there is no better place IMO.  Dalmore 18, Ruinart Rose are standard - always high end.  Marcus is solid, room service is fast/hot, location is central."
"200725","90116","1","Angeleno is a mediocre hotel with aspirations of being upscale.  Unfortunately, the guest services are not as advertised.  The staff has clearly been coached to respond ""That's the situation at present"" to complaints of shortfalls.  The wifi wasn't secure, so I delayed flight sign in."
"200732","90119","1","Unfortunately, one of the nicer rooms was above the street and along the train track so very noisy at times.  We would have liked to have known this ahead of time so we could have made a better choice. 
"
"200737","90121","1","Keep in mind most museums and even parks are closed on Mondays; book tickets for Frida Kahlo museum in advance!"
"200740","90122","1","Worth keeping in mind that because of the location of the hotel, it’s a cab ride to pretty much everywhere. No nearby subway, and a big schlepp down the hill to the nearest restaurants or shops. "
"200743","90123","1","This hotel is primarily for couples and could be a great experience.  My room needed a little TLC"
"200754","90128","1","They provide two bottles of water a day, which was helpful after a night of drinking. It’s the small things that count. "
"200757","90129","1","get a room with a view"
"200760","90130","1","Go for the views, get a suite, don't expect anything special apart from that. and get used to the fog horn blaring every 40 secs or so:)  "
"200765","90132","1","Take some time to sit in the lobby and have a drink or a snack.  Since the lobby was a former church it's big and open and certain times of the day the light comes through the original stained glass windows.  Fun to sit and watch people coming and going.  Comfortable and varied seating options and good tunes.  "

"200857","90169","1","If you don’t mind a VERY tiny room this place is great.  Unfortunately the room was way too small for me.  There is literally no space to even open your bag.  No desk to work at. Not even a chair to sit in.  The room was just too small to accommodate anything other than the bed and end table."
"200864","90172","1","the meat packing district that is behind the hotel has a great array of Bars and restaurants which are a must to visit. We Loved Neighbourhood pizza. Great food and cocktails   "

"200872","90175","1"," Have a Spritz Aperol in the bar and order eggs for breakfast. Walk out and enjoy the local area.  "
"200875","90176","1","In my opinion this is a business hotel only and not suitable for tourists in any way, unless being near the airport is a must. The photos of the pool are misrepresentative as it is now in a completely different location (and anyway was closed during our stay for a private function). As a tourist you are miles away from any interesting districts. "
"200878","90177","1","Do not expect high gourmet food in their restaurants. Visit Boracay village at least once but be aware of traffic. Finally...just relax, chill and enjoy!"
"200881","90178","1","Rooms facing the street can be noisy, so if possible, call ahead and request a room on a high er floor that faces the back/inside of the hotel.

"200998","90228","1","I appreciated the free Dragon Pearl tea that was offered by the front desk when I arrived on my first night and again in the AM when I checked out. The staff also offered a selection of other teas and coffee but DRAGON pearl is my favorite. Room had cookies and a personalized greeting letter waiting for me. I like it when little things add to the pleasure of a hotel stay."
"201001","90229","1","ENJOY your stay"
"201004","90230","1","Allow some time to relax in the room with truly spectacular views overlooking Tokyo, including the Imperial Palace and park. "
"201011","90233","1","DON'T BOOK ON A WEEKEND, OR IF YOU NEED SLEEP ASK TO NOT BE NEAR ANY OTHER GUESTS. "
"201014","90234","0","Walk around, its not a super gentrified location, which I appreciate. The surrounding areas don't feel touristy or super ""posh"" but I loved the character and you can find nice local gems. "
"201039","90246","1","Ottima posizione, bellissimi spazi comuni, ma le camere sono al di sotto dello standard di tablet"
"201046","90249","1","Walk out for coffee! Plenty of choice in the nearby shopping centre."
"201051","90251","1","Duplex with the 2nd bathroom is a real plus."
"201062","90256","1","Book in advance if you want to eat in the restaurant. "
"201065","90257","1","Not near the hustle and bustle of Kyoto, but a very easy 10 minute cab to pretty much anything in the city."
"201068","90258","1","Don't miss the Onsen on the basement level.  A great hotel to stay at to be close to everything in Kyoto"
"201071","90259","1","Stay here if you can it is fantastic"
"201084","90265","1","Do not try this hotel- major disappointment "
"201101","90273","1","Free parking, but easy to get Uber or Lyft. The free continental breakfast is weak, don't count on it.  "
"201104","90274","1","The Library bar is available for patrons only and you definitely should take advantage of that. "
"201109","90276","1","The lofts are dark and the windows are too low. Gov for a deluxe reg room instead."
"201112","90277","1","Parking is a pain and there was no visible bell person who helped and when we did pull up to drop off and pick up, we got the evil stink eye from someone at the hotel as we believe they thought we were an Uber/Lyft. We opted to park on the street (and pay) but there are other ramp options nearby. "
"201115","90278","1","Don’t stay there "
"201120","90280","1","The sushi at the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill is to die for, but be sure to try the fried chicken. And don't miss the fried rice with veggies and fried poached egg. Simply out of this world."
"201123","90281","1","go somewhere else"
"201126","90282","1","No minibar."
"201131","90284","1","Get a room with an open fire and ask for it to be lit! "
"201134","90285","1","If you are a view-holic, then you'd love here.  You should take a room with a riverview.  You need to pay more - around USD 50 but it is worthy of it."
"201139","90287","1"," We loved our secluded cottage ""59 steps"" - but if stairs are a challenge let the staff know so that they can assign accommodations with the least amount of stairs.  Keep in mind that Strawberry Hill is built into the mountainside so steep inclines and steps are part of the landscape. "
"201144","90289","1","si muy bueno hotel"
"201149","90291","1","House 1 is exquisite but does have some traffic noise"
"201154","90293","1","It is not very close to the center (it was convenient for us since we wanted to explore other regions and love to walk) but guests with limited mobility may find it far."
"201157","90294","1","Breakfast expensive; try Starbucks around the corner."
"201160","90295","1","Make the most of the bar: at night or for coffee in the morning. The gym is small but very well equipped, and great for some trainspotting."
"201167","90298","1","Concierge makes excellent recommendations. "
"201178","90303","1","Be sure to research the several room types available to find the one that will suit your needs. Don't expect this to be a snooty 5-star, luxury experience: it's a boutique hotel, and a very nice one. Boutique hotels have quirks, but The Gale has provided us a very nice stay on two occasions. "
"201187","90307","1","Make sure to plan time hanging out in the lounge for drinks one night!"
"201190","90308","1","Don’t stay here! "
"201195","90310","1","you don't need a car but you do need a half an hour to get a taxi. location next to biosphere is remote and not crowded"
"201212","90318","1","Ask for a view room on an upper floor if possible. "
"201221","90322","1","The Dry Martini is a really classy, old school bar that serves the best martinis by men in white jackets and it is on the corner of the same street as the hotel. Total treat and amazing people watching. Go there to soak it all up."
"201226","90324","1","Great place."
"201229","90325","1","There is late night music on weekends in the coutryard which is pretty loud. Bedroom is right next to window on central courtyard. Also all rooms are on an exposed central courtyard so if it is raining you will get wet on the way to your room."
"201232","90326","1","Walk to the pier. Check out the shopping centre next door."
"201239","90329","1","They are building a new bar/tea room and the hotel will be much better for it. "
"201242","90330","1","Stay here! Take advantage of the breakfast in the morning and the fireplace seats!"
"201245","90331","1","This hotel is fine if you are passing through but the neighborhood is really unappealing. You wouldn't want to linger, it can seem a bit squalid around there and has clearly worsened since the economic crisis. Though directly across the street from the hotel is the most brilliant herb shop run by an amazing man who seems to know everything about the subject. One of those special, small places that are real finds."
"201248","90332","1","try to get an outside facing room on a high floor!!"
"201255","90335","1","As a Tablet Plus member I received a bottle of Prosecco and two Dean and Deluca dark chocolate bars upon arrival. "
"201258","90336","1","Be sure when you are booking your room that you have an understanding about the size especially if  you are a couple sharing the same space. "
"201261","90337","1","The complimentary bicycle hire was a real bonus and a fabulous way to explore the beach promenade"
"201268","90340","1","Definitely have a drink in the lounge!"
"201277","90344","1","Grab pool chairs early- 8am for best seats. Hotel is very safe- lots of security and a nice ambiance. Several times we left our phones etc under towels by the pool and went in the ocean. Swim in the ocean early for the calmest cleanest waves. If you wait until afternoon the spa sales lady comes around the pool and you can bargain with her for services- like 2 for 1 massages. Spa is expensive but worth it, give yourself time before and after to enjoy ammenities. Gym is large and lovely. Stock up on water and snacks from the local bodega- Mini Bar and cafe prices are outrageous "
"201284","90347","1","Make sure to take advantage of the wine tasting if you're staying on a Friday or Saturday."
"201289","90349","1","Don’t expect any service or concierge abilities. There is another 25 hours hotel that is 100m/yds away, and cabbies often mistake one for the other."
"201292","90350","1","be hungry at breakfast - the cooked to order breakfast menu is full of delicious food covering both eastern and western styles. Certainly a cut above any of the other food we experienced during our two week trip to Cambodia. Healthy, indulgent and delicious."
"201301","90354","1","Take the guidance of the excellent staff for places to eat . "
"201314","90360","1","I’m a local, so l highly recommend this hotel. It’s close to public transportation, shopping, museums and lots of great restaurants. They actually have a great restaurant - the Cavalier. If you like a modern, clean lined hotel, this would be a good choice. "
"201317","90361","1","The oysters!"
"201322","90363","1","Can't go wrong."
"201327","90365","1","Although the location is not the best (quite unconvenient to get to metro station) the hotel is located in a residential area in one of the most exclusive areas of Bangkok. Quiet and discreet.
Breakfast not included on tablet price, had to pay extra for a set menu with very limited choices. 
Rooms are among the biggest I have had the opportunity to stay. 
Nice decor and concept."
"201330","90366","1","Don't miss the restaurants on 14th Street NW."
"201333","90367","1","Day trip by ferry to Bainbridge Island."
"201336","90368","1","If it’s about price, park offsite"
"201345","90372","1","You should definitely have dinner in Passarola Restaurant - best Tapas in town"
"201350","90374","0","Great for one person."
"201353","90375","1","The courtyard cottages are wonderfully private.  Slip through the garden and order poolside breakfast by picking up the phone near the towel shelf"
"201356","90376","1","Explore the area of Condesa!!"
"201363","90379","1","Dont eat at the restaurant attached - spent time on the 2nd floor - I didn't know this space existed until checking out and it was really cool!"
"201374","90384","1","Be sure to get the Los Poblanos Almanac.  This will give you much needed info about getting food on off days. Also one of the keys you receive will be for the gym, and one will be for the room."
"201385","90389","1","Miese Gegend"
"201388","90390","1","You can reserve a bike for free at the reception! A wonderful and easy way to see the city :)"
"201395","90393","1","Difficult to find! Google map sends you around the corner from entrance. A very enjoyable stay once you find the hotel. "
"201400","90395","1","On checking in, the hotel wanted to place a hold on my debit card for the full payment amount plus $200 for incidentals. I hadn't prepared for this, and needed to move money around before I could check in - which was a little inconvenient. However, the check-in staff were helpful, and accommodating, and it wasn't too much trouble. Had I known this in advance, it would have saved some hassle at check-in. "
"201405","90397","1","Great location, walking distance to 14 Street with lots of fun restaurants, and Phillips Collection gallery, as well as all the normal tourist attractions (White House, Nat'l Gallery etc) It was brutally cold during our stay, but I walked everywhere and loved that part. Take breakfast downstairs in cafe to avoid slow room service as well as $$$ charges."
"201412","90400","1","Relax and enjoy"
"201415","90401","1","I’m generally quite picky about where I stay, however I was very pleased here and have already booked a room for my next visit to Paris. If you knew me, you would understand that this is high praise. You will be happy here. "
"201422","90404","1","Bring a hand mirror if you need to use the blow dryer.  The bathroom electrical outlet is only for shavers and there isn't a mirror anywhere near an outlet so you should bring your own.  "
"201425","90405","1","Room 201, 301, etc and above are great corner rooms with excellent windows and views. "
"201428","90406","1","Breakfast is served all day until 5pm. Whilst you can only go once the sumptuous feast could easily be your only meal of the day.
There are a couple of beach restaurants to the left and right, they serve a great Thai curry."
"201431","90407","1","Take time to look at the art work."
"201436","90409","0","Basic ‘Superior ‘ room is too small. Go for a Deluxe."
"201439","90410","1","I would suggest an ""Ocean"" view room, perhaps ""Cove"".  Personally the thought of a forest view would be a loss at this location.  Keep in mind this spot is 25 minutes from Jenner."
"201442","90411","1","Definitely make a reservation for Saturday eves. And do try the breakfast on Sunday, just delicious. Best pancakes and breakfast burrito like no other. The menu is a mix of Israeli, Mexican and Japanese spices... umm yeah. Yum!"
"201445","90412","1","very small rooms
check in automated, staff a bit dismissive
not in SOHO but 1/4 mile away
transport hard to get (off the path)
"
"201448","90413","1","Don’t miss dinner and drinks at The Rake’s Progress, if you can’t get a reservation just sit at the bar. "
"201453","90415","1","They are laying new sidewalk on Dizengoff, but it's not the hotel's fault! A little loud in the morning..."
"201458","90417","1","Watch out for traffic chaos in soho and areas nearby... plan plenty of time ahead for travel!"
"201465","90420","1","Do NOT book the 2 bed loft room unless you are looking for a family/group accommodation.
The room is at the rear of the hotel & right behind the working kitchen (which you walk through to get to your room). Very noisy from pre breakfast onwards! 
The room was cold (in March).
This room is not suitable for a couple."
"201468","90421","1","Book more than one night. "
"201473","90423","1","Stay on a lower floor - cheaper and very little street noise.  And you can use the stairs to get to the common areas.  I love Room #10"
"201478","90425","1","Go here for location, charm and coziness
Don't if you want the perfect facilities and convenience

The Gore is perfect for the museums, Royal Albert Hall, walks in the Royal Parks and exploring Kensington.  
The furniture, paintings and decoration bring you back in time

But the water pressure is fickle, you can hear other guests in corridors and when they flush the loos, there is only one charger at reception if you forgot yours and space is stretched
"
"201485","90428","1","Come prepared with a small cooler just in case they do not have any refrigeration units available. Make sure to hang out at the bar and speak with the personable staff and locals! And don’t be afraid to take a late night swim in the wonderfully heated pool!"
"201492","90431","1","Get to the cocktail hour on time.  It fills up quickly and there is limited seating.  "
"201497","90433","1","eat at the hotel's restaurants, all excellent and the best around those blocks "
"201502","90435","1","Enjoy this quiet oasis sheltered from the hustle and bustle of the Vegas Strip. "
"201511","90439","1","Design Site 21 21 next door always worth a look"
"201514","90440","1","Unir Coffee is a short work and 24 hours! Coffee shop from Kyoto of the third wave variety"
"201523","90444","1","Great location for restaurants at night and transportation during the day. But the lounge at the hotel was one of the most inviting rooms we found in the city - morning and evenings. "
"201526","90445","1","Good for business, good location"
"201529","90446","1","Difficult for taxis to locate -- before  you arrive, assure that you have the hotel name and address in the local language to share with the taxi driver."
"201534","90448","1","Forget about the size of the room, this is the best location to get anywhere truly cool in NY. End of story. "
"201539","90450","1","You have to park in the middle of the road in front. You check in then get a pass to park in back"
"201542","90451","1","This is a place of wellness and relaxation, and it is a special destination."
"201545","90452","1","on entry, take the steps, not the lift"
"201548","90453","1","Excellent rooms and e extremely clean. Great service."
"201551","90454","1","Take full advantage of the concierge services. Julien and Phillippe are amazing."
"201556","90456","1","Salotto Monti is about a 5-10 min. taxi ride from Termini train station. I was told it was 15 minutes away, but i was there in no time. I was in Rome on an overnight layover and didn't want to spend a lot on a hotel I would only be at for a few hours. The price was very affordable, but the room was very boutique and seemed much more expensive. Last time I was in Rome on a similar layover I paid around the same price but the room was old, uncomfortable and not very clean or polished. "
"201559","90457","1","Do yourself a favor and get a ""large room"" at the back, but this is no guarantee you'll have a good night sleep either."
"201566","90460","1","Please remove from tablet hotel, is not in your standerd"
"201573","90463","1","Don't skip out on the tea based cocktails in the lobby bar. Mingle at the broken shaker on a sunny late afternoon."
"201578","90465","1","Try to get a room on the higher floors. "
"201589","90470","1","The Philosophenweg ( walking trail) is just above the hotel , a great view. And the hotel has bicycle available. "
"201604","90477","1","Get a room not on the train line side 
Explore Damen ave great little shops"
"201607","90478","1","Stay here."
"201610","90479","1","Don’t eat at hotel restaurants. Use concierge service for anything external - fabulous people."
"201613","90480","1","The group own several hotels around Palma. If you can, eat at one of their restaurants. Excellent food."
"201618","90482","0","Overpriced.

Public areas look tired.  Small very small.  "
"201625","90485","1","While the price point is relatively low compared to other boutique properties in this expensive area, you may consider looking at some of the newer properties in Puerto Natales.  "
"201628","90486","1","get a room with a balcony!"
"201631","90487","1","Not a hotel for families "
"201636","90489","1","Stay elsewhere.  "
"201639","90490","1","not close to any MRT or BTS station, but at walking distance from Lumphini Park. Lot of fancy restaurants close by. Surrounded by construction sites so a little noisy during the day. Request a room facing north to avoid heat and be able to open courtains."
"201646","90493","1","The honor bar in the evening is a lot of fun, ask the front desk for restaurant recommendations, you won't be disappointed.  My favorites were Geist, MASH and the dining room at the Hotel D'Angleterre."
"201651","90495","1","I would request a room NOT on the ground floor. I had room 101 right next to the reception and although there were double doors it was loud at times."
"201654","90496","1","Don't base your reservation on pictures. It is a basic hotel with a nice, clean room close to everything in Sedona but it is nothing like the pictures. "
"201657","90497","1","This is my third stay, you'll like it here too."
"201662","90499","1","SYAT HERE! its a great location, the rooms are so beautiful and the facility itself is super cool. Great restaurant in the Lobby area."
"201669","90502","1","The view of the Tokyo Tower is now partially obstructed by a newly built office building. Take that into consideration when picking a room."
"201674","90504","1","Be mindful of requesting a quiet room as street noise and lobby noise is really loud and invasive. "
"201679","90506","1","Nehmt die Suites in den obersten Etagen!"
"201682","90507","1","Most of the rooms overlook the Square, which is very picturesque, but also very noisy at night with a rooftop cocktail bar just across the way. 
"
"201687","90509","1","Restaurant recommendations were perfect and Veronica was an incredible host, ensuring we had a great experience."
"201694","90512","1","As described, this hotel is quite far away from the city center. Finding late night food was tough for me. 
"
"201697","90513","1","Plein de charme, dans un quartier super sympa et commerçant."
"201702","90515","1","nice location"
"201711","90519","1","Don’t stay here
They don’t know what they’re doing
People smoke in their non smoking rooms -cigarettes and weed
The staff is rude and oblivious when you complain.  They forget turndown.  They forget to give you the tablet plus rewards. "
"201716","90521","1","The rooms on the website looked really chic and boutique-y, however the reality was very different. The furniture was pretty run down, and all the highlight cushion and bed throws were no more.
The ""view"" out the window was also really disappointing - I stared straight into the building next door, meaning natural light wasn't really a big thing in my room! 
It was also super noisy with music being played outside somewhere every night until 2.30pm. The fridge in my room was also super old and noisy, as was the air con. The cleaning staff completely ignored my ""do not disturb"" signs at all, meaning I didn't have a very restful stay. "
"201719","90522","1","Some junior suits have a rather unattractive large bath tub in the middle of the room. Best avoided! "
"201722","90523","1","I would actually advise to avoid. My worst US hotel experience in 6 years."
"201727","90525","1","They have jazz in the lobby on Thursday evenings.  Highly recommend the breakfast."

"201820","90564","1","Location is great! Very conveniently located and close to Bourbon street, the french quarter and the warehouse district."
"201823","90565","1","Ask if staying in dog-friendly rooms which room you book, they're only permitted in the ground level suites, which have doors out to the back. Great but a higher price point."
"201826","90566","1","I recommend room 14 which is very spacious by Parisian standards. "
"201829","90567","1","Enjoy!!"
"201832","90568","1","For a room with a view select bay or quay, otherwise your view will be of the internal courtyard."

"201897","90595","0","It's a great stay if you don't run into issues.  The hotel did not have great followup or communication."

"201932","90611","1","Be prepared for intense sun. Many guests left the resort for long expeditions but we were content to hang by the pools and take a few relatively short watercraft excursions. If you're staying several days, take the free shuttle to the nearby Four Seasons for a change of venue and slightly better food. "

"201968","90625","1","It seems there are a lot of younger guests staying in his hotel. There were drunk girls partying in the hallway until 2am- and while I know there are some things beyond the hotel’s means, they should enforce perhaps not having people be so loud when the hotel is typically a place for people to rest their heads and get some sleep."

"202131","90696","1","This is a perfect spot to discover the city from. In the middle of the actions and very comfortable. Definitely not a place to stay if you plan to hang out at the hotel too much, because they don't really have any common areas. Staff is super friendly and always happy to help."
"202136","90698","1","Request a room away from the elevator.

They have apples in the hotel room. I don't suggest eating them because I tried eating all of them, and they obviously had been sitting there for a while."

"202157","90707","1","This place is a great value, and is gorgeous. Great food at the nearby malls."
"202160","90708","1","No turn down service.  You don't want a ""great village view"" room.  It shares not only your immediate balcony space, but the extended area which, in our case, shared with two other rooms.  The room to the east took our daybed immediately in front of our room and used it with direct view of our inner room.  Obviously, we had to shut the shutters for privacy which made our room dark in sunny so cal.  Weird layout."
"202169","90712","1","They charge a mandatory $18 per day fee for, I guess, internet, access to the gym and business center. Incredibly annoying that hotels get away with this, but there you go."
"202178","90716","1","If you love good food in a great neighborhood, stay here. Check out the rooftop lounge...beautiful views and excellent cocktails."
"202181","90717","1","Room 504 has a great view. It's a little loud because of the street noise but ear plugs are provided. The rooftop bar is one of our favourites in the city."
"202184","90718","1","Love"
"202189","90720","1","Loved this hotel.  There was some construction next door, Was concerned at first about the noise but  it ended up not being an issue because we were gone during the day.  Also, there were quite a few families with kids-"
"202194","90722","1","Skip the room cleaning one of your nights, so that you can get a free drink. "
"202199","90724","1","Higher floors are nice. There are no upgrades at this hotel as apparently they only have 5 suites in the whole place. "
"202202","90725","1","If you want big rooms this is not the hotel you'd want to choose. "
"202205","90726","0","Don't expect any favor.  They always say no!!!"

"202224","90734","1","Get the lobster roll."
"202227","90735","1","It’s a great little boutique hotel at the heart of Rome. Natural there is some noise but it is expected and the windows are very good quality and do a good job at minimizing the effect."
"202230","90736","1","Andaz is not meant to be a four star hotel, so you should not expect that level of service, otherwise its reasonably priced and a fine hotel."
"202239","90740","1","Watch the weather, the bathrooms for tents and tent cabins are completely outdoors. It was way to cold and windy to even imagine taking a shower. Definitely camping!"
"202246","90743","1","be careful about room facing street; bars across street/people loitering outside middle of night can make it very noisy even on upper floors. woke me up two nights in a row"
"202249","90744","1","Snag a pool lounge chair early in the day"
"202252","90745","1","Great location"
"202259","90748","1","The well-known Bird café is close with tasty and generous burgers.  The bakery on the corner (opposite the U-Bahn station) is also good for coffee and delicious buns!"
"202262","90749","1","Hotel is a bit dated and all the fake retro stuff done relatively cheaply is a bit off putting. Also everything is ridiculously dark, not from a cool point of view; more from a we seem to be walking into things and not finding things all the time point of view."
"202267","90751","1","We had great weather but apparently early March and Feb can be rainy so some excursions may not be available at that time. The guides and activity manager were great about talking with us to help figure out how to make the best use of our time there with activities and excursions that suited our interest and ability. Multiple times we were alone with a personal guide and driver, when there were groups they were small and it was a nice chance to interact with guests from around the world. "
"202274","90754","1","Make use of the public spaces - there aren't many spaces in the city surrounded with this much greenery and it's a luxury."
"202277","90755","0","No safes + no room service. At this price would expect much, much more. Regret the choice. "
"202280","90756","1","Excellent atmosphere. Attentive customer service. You will feel special. Perfect environment to relax but also very appropriate for work. Conveniently located at the heart of the vibrant Shoreditch neighborhood. I would recommend this property for a great weekend escape to London and or if you have business on the east side of London. Nobu restaurant and bar downstairs are a must. Try the spa. My Plus membership provided me with a nice upgrade including complimentary breakfast. If you are here on a Sunday, go venture on Brick Lane."
"202287","90759","1","A car rental is helpful but not essential. "
"202290","90760","1","The hotel is located about 5-10 min walk from nearest metro stop or ~1000 yen Taxi from downtown. It’s a quiet neighbourhood which we really enjoyed, not minding not being in the thick of it of downtown or Gion."
"202293","90761","1","Professional Concierges on staff will assist with dining options if you are unfamiliar with the area.  "

"202314","90769","1","Go in the warm season, I felt out of place in fairly 'cold' March."
"202317","90770","1","Forego valet parking and park in the garage behind the hotel for $6 a day. The Madison is in the process of renovation on the upper floors and there is no food or beverage service at this time, but there was no intrusive construction noise."
"202322","90772","1","Very good location but extremely noisy. Don't go there if you want a quiet stay, the street noise at all hours is really really loud."
"202327","90774","1","The hotel rooms are very similar to a dorm room or hostel.  Bathroom and amenities very spare.  Breakfast buffet ok, coffee not good, but plenty of good cafes nearby.
Overall, this was a much lower level of hotel than I have come to expect from Tablet after being a Tablet Plus member for several years.  The description of boutique hotel implies a higher level."

"202351","90784","1","Stay here!"
"202358","90787","1","Get a room in the interior. We had no problems with sound, as others did, and the room was completely quiet."
"202361","90788","1","Make sure you tell the front desk you are a Tablet member, because I had to ask for the extra benefits, they did not automatically offer them."
"202366","90790","1","Beach is not a ""private"" or exclusive as the description makes it sound. Although beach chairs are included, umbrellas are an additional charge and the services are nominal. Not a great hotel if you are a beach person. Better to be by the pool. "
"202369","90791","1","You might want to splurge on the breakfast buffet, you won't be hungry for lunch!
Ask about the free shuttle. The hotel is within easy walking distance of most places on the Kowloon side, but the shuttle is helpful if the weather isn't good."
"202380","90796","1","Fiquem nesse hotel, é demais, cafe da manhã sensacional, e a localização é ótima, perto de tudo"

"202420","90813","1","The suite has a concrete building as a vie , no balcony , perhaps some have , not ours , depending on your needs premier  room better
The breakfast are v generous no need to lunch if you’re as lazy as we were 
"
"202425","90815","1","If you are taking a day trip they will pack you a breakfast to go...very thoughtful."
"202428","90816","1","Go the baths during the hotel guest only periods - it's very crowded during the ""regular"" times so made it less enjoyable for us"
"202431","90817","1","Probably better for day-trippers looking for a pool-side setting outside of Marrakech than someone looking for a hotel. "
"202438","90820","1","Allow yourself a few a day or two of your vacation to just relax at the hotel. The pool and bar are great. The kayaks and paddleboards are right there and easy to use. "

"202462","90830","1","I thought the full English breakfast was expensive. You can get the same thing for less than half the price at a cafe 50 yards from the hotel. The Emirates cable car offers a stunning view over the Thames. I would also encourage people to visit Trinity Buoy Wharf which is an enclave of small businesses in historic buildings about half a mile from the hotel."
"202465","90831","1","There is sunblock and extra water provided near the pool for free. Take a water bottle to the beach and spend your money on food or specialty drinks instead. "

"202534","90860","1","This is a grown up hotel offering a flavour of ""authentic"" Japanese hospitality (albeit with western concessions such as conventional bed) in a gracious, aesthetically stunning setting. Somewhat uncompromising, so not really one for a travel-weary family with small kids in tow."
"202547","90866","1","Lower your expectations and enjoy the location!"
"202550","90867","1","The hotel is great, but as with most hotels in NYC, the rooms are small. "
"202553","90868","1","Stay at the ""luxury"" rooms.  Standard rooms don't offer the charm of the hotel, you may as well stay anywhere else in Paris."

"202588","90883","1","I'd stay here again. Its excellent value for your money given where it is located. "
"202591","90884","1","Quaint throwback 1980s style of lodging, the polar opposite of an authentic Japanese hostelry, if that's what people were looking for.  Stunning location and views.  Very pricey for (by Western standards) a a hotel of this nature, as impeccable as the service was and as immaculate the condition of the rooms and public spaces were."

"202709","90933","1","Request upgrade to corner room, The views were fantastic."
"202720","90938","1","Be prepared for hotel to block $150 per night as incidentals. This is mandatory amount. Seems excesive. "

"202767","90957","1","Go for rooms 28 or 47 and give up any dreams of a view and expect old world plumbing which, miraculously works."
"202776","90961","1","Highly, highly recommended. If you have time and do not mind paying rather more than a taxi, ask the hotel to arrange a boat to take you to Old Istanbul. It's a great trip. There is also Park Fora, an excellent fish restaurant across the Bosphorous from the hotel; the hotel's boat drops you off at a public mooring and then it's a five minute walk to the left (south). The hotel can also arrange for the boat to pick you up after your meal, or you may return by taxi."
"202779","90962","1","The smaller boutique hotels are nice for a more intimate stay, but there is something to be said for the service a bigger hotel can provide (e.g. porters for bags, etc.)."
"202788","90966","1","We used our Tablet Plus privileges to get an upgrade to the Junior Suite. It's situated by itself on the 4th floor, with an elevator that lets you off right in your room (with key access). The room was really nice with a huge walk-in closet and beautiful views out the huge windows."

"202962","91041","1","A great, stylish, friendly, good value place to base yourself in LA.  20 min Uber drive up to West Hollywood or Beverley Hills, 15 min walk from the MTA. The Hollywood Hills View rooms are an LA experience in themselves. The restaurant is a beautiful place for breakfast but if you don't fancy a meal there's a cafe in the lobby to pick up coffee and pastries or order a tiffin-tin breakfast to your room. "
"202965","91042","1","At first glance the room seemed very basic and felt stark and too retro. However after a few hours we got into the rhythm of the place and appreciated the simplicity, quiet and calm of this desert spa retreat. We didn't want to leave by the end. The pools are open 24/7 for a hot mineral soak or a swim under the stars. There's not much going on in the town of Desert Hot Springs but it's a short 20 min drive into Palm Springs for dinner if that appeals and Uber and Lyft both service the area. In 2018 it cost us about $22 each way. "

"203100","91096","1","It is a romantic -like tiny hotel in a great Parisian location with dedicated staff. A bit too Disney-esque in its championing the Mona Lisa story; small rooms even when upgraded and practically no public rooms.  Not my 1st choice if you are in Paris for work. "

"203106","91098","1","Just for once, a luxury hotel proper worth every penny spent. You can enjoy an evening in Shanghai from the skyscrapers in Pudong, but if you're going to really get i to Shanghai and its best neighbourhoods for say a week or so, The PuLi is by far #1 most recommended hotel option. An oasis downtown in one of the world's busiest cities."

"203118","91102","1","TI highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience an unforgettable holiday, in search of a hidden, peaceful place by the Tuscan sea. There numerous beautiful beaches and towns in the area. Talamone is a great kite surf spot. Also Bagno delle donne and Tramonto are just a few ideal places for a day at the sea. While Ptigliano, Orbetello, Sorano and Montalcino are some of the most unique, historical villages, with great restaurants. "

"203155","91116","1","May want to ask for a waterview and pay the extra cost. It was raining when I was there and said no, but then it cleared up 10 minutes later and it was beautiful out so I regretted not getting the view. Next time for sure!"
"203160","91118","1","Surface space is very limited due to tiny bedside tables and small bathroom counters, so pack with that in mind! Also, beware if you are sensitive to scents as the public areas of the hotel are perfumed."
"203169","91122","1","This vintage respite is quaint and quirky and could use some TLC and more extensive maintenance/renovation.  I am guessing that because the hotel is 'dry' that it receives less attention from potential guests and from the hotelier. It is run by adorable young people who have yet to completely master top notch service, but who are dear, charming, and helpful."
"203176","91125","1","Not worth the low price point."
"203179","91126","1","If you do decide to eat lunch/dinner, it is better to eat at the ""spa"" location instead of the bar in the lobby. I think they probably cook at the other location and bring to the lobby. Service is better at the spa location - bar tender in the lobby didn't seem as friendly or attention oriented as the rest of the service staff."
"203184","91128","1","The regular rooms are modern and light. Lower floors are easier because you can take the stairs.The show rooms are not to everyone's taste, dark and awkward because they are all about the preservation of historical features, and very overpriced relative to the other rooms. "

"203365","91203","1","If you're only looking for a good location, this is fine.  If you enjoy thoughtful and proper service, based on our experience, this is not the hotel for you.  Overall, it's just ok."

"203451","91238","1","Lo consiglio senz'altro!"
"203454","91239","1","I upgraded to a suite with a bathtub, but still found the room to be very small (just a few feet around the bed in all directions). The bathtub was also lovely, but it was a small soaking tub that you sit in (fine for me, but not for a large person or most adult males I would imagine). Looking back I would not have chosen to upgrade given the room was still small and the bathtub was not one I could fully extend in and relax in. Everything was wonderful though. "
"203457","91240","1","keep in mind that even tho it's a quaint location you do have a lot of airplane noises above - landing and starting. Not ideal."

While the service team indicated that they were winding down and staying through May 1 primarily to get their severance packages, I could detect no deterioration in service levels or cleanliness, etc. Everything was great.  However, I think Tablet had an obligation to tell guests booking at the hotel that the hotel would be closing for good the day after they checked out! Knowing that would likely affect some guests' decision to stay there, and in all likelihood it would've affected mine.  But I can't fault the hotel at all...I wish it weren't closing!"

There are also limitations within the hotel. You have to pay extra to use the pool (I didn't check, but guessing not less than $100 extra) as well as even to have access to the top floor bar.  It's beautiful and the service is unrivaled, but know that you will pay a fortune here, and the room price is deceiving.

The economy room we had was very small. It’s a very narrow stairway to get up to the second floor receptionist. However, the three young receptions who aleternated manning the desk were extremely helpful making restaurant and tourist sights reservations for us.

"205755","92197","1","I booked knowing that noise would be a bit of an issue, based on the location (Gaslamp) and on reviews on various sites. It honestly was better than I had feared, at least in my fourth story room. Over three nights (Monday-Wednesday) I had two untroubled sleeps; a third would have been fine if a couple of drunken female guests hadn’t persistently pounded on my door after 1 am until they realized they had made an error and wandered off without apology. (As I didn’t interact with any other guests and barely saw any, I don’t know if they were typical or not). 

Another expectation modification that will help is to note that this hotel is on the cheap end - the Andaz two blocks over was about $150 more per night. So while the room was comfortable and had some nice design touches (e.g. very large shower, espresso machine), these didn’t really outweigh its slightly “past its prime” vibe (e.g. while the room was clean, the furniture was noticeably stained). It felt like it was about a year or two overdue for a complete overhaul. Again, still comfortable and (for me) quiet enough, but don’t expect this to be one of Tablet’s grander offerings. "
"205758","92198","1","If you need a gym, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. So tiny and you're screwed if there's another person in there. "

"205773","92204","1","I wouldn't bother taking the hotel taxi service--it's over-priced for Hanoi, and the driver I had assumed what his tip would be and didn't give me proper change when I paid him. When I asked for all of my change he gave me a nasty attitude. Order a Grab app ride instead."
"205782","92208","1","It is hard to decide which room to choose.  If you want the best view, go for a room in the main house.  If you like privacy and feeling one with nature, opt for the yellow or red bungalow."
"205787","92210","0","The mini room is really just a hostel/dorm room. It is totally fine for one or two people who don't plan to spend a lot of time in their rooms, but it's cramped. The sink is outside the bathroom --- in the room next to the TV. Was not a huge deal for me, but some might be surprised."
"205790","92211","1","The clientele here is overall VERY young.  Though it was a Sunday morning for us, there's a huge construction site across the street that insures you will not be sleeping in. We had the same noisy pipes in the middle of the night as another reviewer did :("

"205838","92230","1","My tip would be do yourself a favor, respectfully, and check this place out. It's stunning. The hotel also is accommodating if you would like to be on a higher floor which I would highly recommend to get the sweeping views of the city."
"205847","92234","1","The hotel is conveniently located near South Kensington station, surrounded by cafes and close to Kensington Gardens. A Tablet Plus upgrade was unavailable and initially I was given Room 6 on the ground floor with the bus stop outside. Not pleasant. I asked for a change and was given a nice, albeit small, room on the fourth floor. There was some ambiguity in the other Plus privileges. I was told I could have a complimentary  champage on both nights but when I asked the second night I was told I couldn’t. (Awkward). I didn’t receive the seasonal welcome gift.  The breakfast bufffet was very nice though."

It’s Gorgeous 
Recommend room 229, although I’m sure many others are just as lovely. 
"
"206353","92448","1","It's a bright new hotel that leads in eco friendly so offers that as part of the luxury experience. Shared spaces and rooms are very good. Roof top bar and pool are small so can get full making it tricky to find a relaxing space to hang out. It is full of energy for those who like a scene. "
"206358","92450","1","I highly recommend Hotel on Rivington for your NYC stay. While the streets can get a little noisy the higher floors are quieter and have a great view. It is the lower east side so heaps of cafes, restaurants, shops and interesting streets to walk around. Staff were great and Tblet plus upgrade and freebies worth it. "
"206364","92452","0","Enjoy the quiet of the Dorsoduro side & use the nearby traghetto to get across to San Marco side."
"206371","92455","1","Note that the hotel is about 5-10 outside of town, up the hill, so you will need a car/taxi to go to and from the city itself.
Dinner at the restaurant was incredible.  Modern with a Basque history, and inventive without being overly fussy.  Book in advance.
Spend the days in the town itself, roaming the Parte Viejo from pintxo bar to pintxo bar, and checking out the beaches in Ondarreta, La Concha and Gros. Drive up to France for a day."

The roofdeck where breakfast is served is very small. we arrived and there were 3 parties of 2 and there was barely enough room for the 4 of us. The women serving were very accomodating but it caused another party of guests to have to move seats and shift around to make room for us.  Not the most pleasant breakfast experience."

Considerably less expensive than Aman or Gritti for clean modern rooms.

Anywhere but Venice the hotel would be overpriced from a service perspective - but for Venice it's a good option.

The Sina side of the Canal is quieter at night and although it's about 10 minutes walk to any decent restaurants - it is a good base for a few nights in Venice."

Breakfast buffet was among best I've ever had and it included things like Eggs Benedict cooked to order. Beautiful terraces, restaurants and bar areas.

allways were very dark and narrow and tiny elevators BUT this should not deter you. It's very typical of an older restored European hotel. "
"206685","92583","1","Highly recommend Hotel am Steinplatz. The service is top notch. They make you feel like you're the only guest. Must try the ""clear"" craft cocktails in the hotel bar, which was rated the top bar in Berlin for the last 3 years. "

Do not use valet parking if you do not mind walking for 4minutes. Parking is available for ~$10/day instead of the $50 with valet and more importantly you get the car when you want instead of waiting for an hour."

"206917","92679","1","The Barri Gotic (Gothic District) is a cool area, but it is also certainly pretty ""gritty."" If that is what you are going for then you will not be disappointed, but if you are only mildly edgy (that's us) it might be a little too graffiti-d and ""aromatic"" for your tastes. Really unique and cool historical area though. Be aware that due to tiny streets that have been around way longer than cars that it will sometimes require a walk to get to a taxi, but typically not bad. As I mentioned, the property is in a very lovely old gothic building."

Nothing was redone and when staying on older properties I want to know that older hotel are revamping and making their spaces desirable.  The exterior and location are very beautiful.  The interior is extremely depressing and was not accommodating to small children.  Also don’t get stuck in one of the rooms that you have to travel through 2 elevators to get to your room.  "

"207005","92715","1","Sad to say, but this is one of the worst hotels we’ve ever stayed at. We do travel well, but are not snobs. This place unfortunately struck out on all of the basics...
* Air Conditioning: horrible throughout the entire hotel and zero other ventilation, which is almost unbearable in the Summer. On top of this, after the hotel admitted this was a problem, they charged us for our waters when we were dripping sweat in the room and couldn’t even sleep. I found that quite obnoxious. 
* WiFi: horrendous, which is obviously less than ideal when traveling internationally. Basically unusable. Not only was it insanely slow (couldn’t even get emails to load), but, on top of that, it kept going out. He hotel saw no issue with this - again, clearly something that needs to be fixed.
* Room: tiny + extremely dark (no natural laught, which was fine, but lighting also horrible) 
* Lacks basic amenities... like being able to do a cash advance, which is very common when catering to international travelers. 

On the positive side, the hotel staff is very friendly. They know these issues exist and feel bad the improvements are largely out of their hands."

Before booking, however, I recommend checking the state of the Tulum beach - when we visited in July 2018, there was an algae infestation that was so severe that we basically could not swim in the sea; and the Hotelito Azul, like most Tulum hotels, does not have a swimming pool.

"207372","92869","1","You stay at the Boro for the view, or if you have a family, and need a little more space (without compromising on quality). The Long Island City is being transformed, with construction happening on each street. You won't find a supermarket within ~10 mins of the hotel, and the train is a good 10-minute walk also.  

I had reached out prior to my arrival, to alert the front desk that I was a Tablet member. The front desk did read out the benefits supplied, but didn't issue vouchers, or arrange the complimentary fruit and water amenity (which turned out to be an orange, banana, and bottle of water valued at ~$25). There's nowhere really to dine outside of the hotel itself, so you do feel a little hotel locked, on a relatively suburban street.  "

"207433","92894","1","This is truly a boutique hotel - run by the owners and not be a corporate controlling interest. The restaurant occupies the central part of the business and is the central ""avenue"" of everything that happens.  You should absolutely check out the shop - it's well curated and very tasteful.  
The Petermaai area is still in transition, so don't expect a Disney-like experience.  There aren't any ""bad"" areas, but some of the buildings are still in poor condition and you'll see gaps where old buildings have been taken down and nothing replaced.  To us, this added to the charm, but if you are a traveler that prefers a perfectly manicured experience, I would suggest staying elsewhere on the island. "

I think that should be part of the review for TabletHotels.  The warning should be obvious.  Should be a given.  And that those little warnings on no A/C, such a noisy area, earplugs to ward off the noise (unbearable for 4 nights!), And what gives with the Credit Card Fee? This should be factored in for the hotel.  Better yet, choose Nobis Hotel in Copenhagen.  You'd probably get better service for this price.

However, I must say I don’t think this is worthy of a place on the Tablethotels website. Usually their recommendations are exceptional, a surprise and delite when you arrive. This hotel was a little run down. It’s in real need of upkeep and repair, new paint and some new tile work. To charge those prices with worn out rugs on the floor and a very loved looking sofa in the room was surprising. Lastly, we were in London during a heat wave and the air was blowing mildly cool air at low pressure. My father who is in his 70’s was avoiding going back because he didnt want to sleep in a hot room. Poor experience and I most definitely won’t recommend to friends or family when they come to visit London. "

Housekeeping steams the sheets, folds and hangs your clothes, provides turndown service (confection + bedroom slippers/mat + the next day’s weather forecast), etc. And I believe it’s only two ladies. If you’re a light sleeper and/or you’re not accustomed to city noise, don’t stay in a suite that faces Relox (the front entrance). You’ll hear everything. Also, the church bells ring throughout the day and night. They’re inescapable no matter what room you’re in. Thankfully, you’re provided with fresh ear plugs daily (part of turndown service). "

You have to be used to saying ‘non gracias’ to the relentless hawkers but if you’re not able to deal with that then don’t go out in the street in Cartagena.

Overall, a nice place to stay but not very romantic and not within walking distance of anything interesting. You feel like you're in the suburbs. The pool is not inviting and feels like motel pool. No hot tub."
"209418","93713","1","Even if the price seems a little higher than other places, don't forget you get breakfast, parking, wifi and snacks all included! This place is so lovely and so relaxing and you can walk to all the wonderful places in downtown Healdsburg- you won't need your car at all."

"209531","93760","1","Look around to the more new hotels in Capri, this hotel is dated, with poor customer interaction & basic breakfast. 
Given the price if you are tight on budget book somewhere else. The basic rooms are just that basic- great view but awkward spaces that don’t function well. 
Note the hotel allows children/families. If you are looking for a relaxing time by the pool this isn’t your resort- children everywhere. "

We were at home from the first moment. I would definitely go back and stay here again.  "

The rooms epitomize Scandanavian minimalism and are well designed.   The staff are friendly and the breakfast is outstanding--by far one of the memorable breakfast meals at a hotel.   Overall, this hotel is worth a prolonged stay."

"211694","94657","1","No parking available so be prepared to park and walk or valet park.  We did not mind using the valet parking services for one night but if you’re there for more than one night I’m sure It can get pretty pricey. Also the room we stayed in had a shower only and did not have a bath tub.  I am a bath tub person so that was a little disappointing.  It would’ve been nice if that had been noted some where when I booked the room or even mentioned at check in. The customer service was outstanding and the cleanliness of the room was way above other hotels I’ve been in. I was very, very happy.  The price we were able to get on Tabet was amazing.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat . "

The bathroom was serviceable (the frosted window in mine let in tons of light) and the hotel felt plenty safe, but know you’ll be in one of San Francisco’s grittier neighborhoods.

We got a deluxe corner  King with a stunning view on the 37th floor. Pool is great for laps and we always found a chaise despite the limited number.

This drops off after midnight and unless you are very sensitive to noise you shouldn't worry about it, but if you're looking for minimal noise you should ask for a room on the side of the building facing away from the tracks.

"213095","95240","1","This is a hotel for people who have come to hike and see the glaciers.  The architecture is contemporary with views of a lake and mountains, but there are no frills.  Also, it's not close to the village.  One must take cab to get to the town."
"213100","95242","1","I loved having windows that opened on to the street but you can hear street sounds for sure if that's an issue. "

It was impossible for our child to fall asleep - and for us as well. We rung up front desk and they stated that - ""we have parties here - would you like us to move you"" Which is impossible with a child and bags to move at 10pm at night. When approached the next day at front desk - they had the least sympathy I have experienced of a front desk team and said - ""unfortunately we have parties here"" "

"213305","95325","0","Great location a block from Pike Place Market and close to public transport. There is only one elevator for the whole hotel so there were often long waits. The space is beautifully designed and rooms a good size, though the bathroom is tiny and water pressure very soft."
"213308","95326","1","
We really just wanted to end our weekend at a hotel where we would feel taken care of and special, and instead we felt entirely like an afterthought and an imposition. Luxury experience to cost ratio is very low — I highly recommend staying away.

I tried this hotel because my previous one was awful and I changed my reservation (despite great reviews and a similar price). 
When I arrived, I was greeted and assisted to the front desk. There was a live jazz band playing in the lobby. 
I was immediately checked in early. My room was immaculate and adorable. I asked for toothpaste, they arrived immediately with two brushes and paste. The room service was healthy and delicious. Only thing was the pillows were a bit overfilled for me. Can’t win them all.
Aside from that, I will absolutely come back to show everyone this gem!! "
"213378","95355","1","If you like really firm beds and are traveling alone and not sharing the space, might be a fine experience for you. Just wasn’t a match for me. "
"213389","95360","1","This hotel is amazing, but guests should understand the hotel property sits back from the water quite a bit. There is a main thoroughfare between, that runs parallel to the coastline. Our room had a very limited view to the water and it was considered “ocean front”. One other note in general on Holbox... mosquitos are a big issue. Bring necessary spray. The hotel kindly provided a “natural” alternative, but it didn’t work for me. Just a tip... this should not sway anyone from considering Holbox... it’s quite magical. "

"213397","95363","1","Surtout demander une chambre loin du restaurant... et de préférence à l'étage. C'est ce que nous avions fait, mais suite à un problème de communication, notre demande n'avait pas été prise en compte. Du coup, la première chambre qu'on nous a proposée... le numéro 3 au rez-de-chaussée près du resto... était hyper, hyper bruyante. Ca aurait été insupportable de devoir y rester. Après avoir bien insisté, nous avons heureusement réussi à changer de chambre."

"213478","95397","0","This place has two towers: a completely renovated one, and one that's decades old. There's no disclaimer of this on the website, so we were unlucky and ended up in a room with a tiny ""queen"" (not really a queen) bed. When we were about to leave the place with my wife and 7-months old baby, they remembered to tell us that there were other ""nicer"" rooms available. Went to see them quickly and they were DAY AND NIGHT DIFFERENCE; from heater system, to bed and tv size. Thus, we changed rooms- paying for an upgrade. On our last night, I called the front desk asking for a late check out the next day, so we could be peacefully avoiding the cold weather, before our train. I was told that the cost of doing that was 15 pounds per hour. It's REALLY NOT about the money, but totally out of principle: what semi-decent hotel does that, particularly after a rocky start with the rooms situation? The manager here is no nowhere to be seen in all of these awful experiences, of course. All in all, you don't want to stay here. It's too much of a hassle if you are used to being treated well by staff, either in big or boutique hotels."

"214244","95705","1","There are probably other places in the area that would be better to stay at.  
Double and triple check your bill while there.  Also you'll need to remind them of your 'Tablet' price versus what they want to charge you at checkout.  Not just us but another guest who was checking out at the same time as us had the same problem.
ALSO, as of writing this review, Tablet still lists on the amenities lineup, SAUNA and STEAM...do not believe it.  There is a SPA at the hotel.  The Sauna and the Steam rooms live in the Spa.  If you get a treatment there (which are overpriced  and we live in the SF Bay Area so thats saying a lot) then you can use the sauna/steam.  Otherwise its $50/day even if you're a hotel guest.  Extremely misleading.  If you really are still thinking of staying here - do your own research on the hotels website, other travel booking sites etc.  Tablet is a nice 'list' of hotels.  As far as finding out full information on a hotel - not worth it.  I'll be canceling my PLUS membership."
"214247","95706","1","Go with your itinerary planned. Don't stay long or plan to eat out lots to break the monotony of hotel food offering. The hotel is on the other side of the Island. Probably best to go if you play golf."

It's also very self-service...you check in at a kiosk on your own (there's no formal reception desk).

But what makes this hotel special is the first class (Four Seasons-level) service. Not only is the staff super attentive but there are services included in the room price like on-call SUV hotels cars, apres-ski cocktails and snacks, and a wide range of delicious breakfasts. My favorite was when they had our ski boots and helmets laid out for us in the morning all warmed up!"
"214332","95742","1","This is not a design hotel."
"214335","95743","1","The wifi is very unstable; they tell you there are 4 different networks to choose from, but only 1 works reliably, if it shows up at all, which it sometimes didn't. A pro is that they clean the rooms (very well) many times throughout the day; which was also a con for us, as we left for 10 minutes at 8 in the morning one day to grab coffee and came back to find them already in our room. (There is no do not disturb sign provided to deter this, and instead of saying they'd return later, they asked us to wait in the lobby until they were done). The staff are lovely and courteous, but we didn't love having to interact any time we saw them, but it seemed to be what they had been told to do. (You need to buzz into the building every time you return, for instance, which turned into a conversation at the door every time.)"

They weren't flexible and overall quality of staying there didn't equal to how much we paid two nights at the hotel. I would not stay there again and don't recommend it. "

"214875","95969","1","Quiet location adjacent to Palazzo Pitti. You feel like you’re staying in a guest room of someone’s home. While concierge was always available by phone, their desk hours are limited. SoprArno is great for self-sufficient travelers who seek more style and service than an airbnb, but a less commercial feel than a chain hotel. "

I strongly recommend this hotel and am definitely going to stay here the next time I am in London."
"214945","95999","1","Reach out in advance and have the manager arrange your arrival transportation.  The Riad is at the end of a narrow alleyway and your common cab driver would not recognize the address.  We were lucky that somebody called and was able to translate directions to the cab driver.  Still, we stood in front of the hotel for a couple of minutes before we realized we were right in front of the door, since the 73 in the name has nothing to do with the door  number, and the sign is very inconspicuous."

The hotel is situated nicely on a quiet street, but really quite close to key attractions like Palacio Real, Gran Via, Plaza Mayor and Mercato San Miguel. It’s a rough gem in my opinion. Try the vegetarian place next door - Sanissimo- amazing tasting meals that even non vegetarians will like (I’m not vegetarian), and the small bookshop up the road. The plaza in front of Teatro Real always has something going on. Walk around the back streets around the hotel and there are a few tabernas worth trying that’s not too busy with tourists."

The walls are paper thin, so also could hear others enjoying themselves through the walls! When i say paper thin, we could literally hear people quietly getting into bed in another room. It was not peaceful or restful at all. We were on level 7 with the nightclub on level on 2 so not sure how high you have to go to not hear the music!?

This meant I got spectacular direct views of the White House, but had to sleep on a sofa bed. For me it was worth it but I  don't think I really focused on the sofa bed part.  Apparently if they haven't rented the suites, they are able to break them up and rent each space separately.  The presidential suite view was really superb "

"216766","96761","1","The good: The rooms are beautiful and quite unique. They are pet-friendly. Probably one of the best pools in the city, only open to hotel guests... they were quite good about kicking out people from the rooftop bar who wandered over which was much appreciated. The bath products SMELL AMAZING. Super hot showers. Love the built-in Bluetooth speakers built into the bed. If you book with Tablet Hotels, you get an amazing breakfast buffet that is available until noon!

The bad: While Mexico City does not get too hot, the AC is absolutely useless, it actually made our room hotter during the evening than leaving the doors or windows open. The bed is quite hard. Expect to hear the music and scraping chairs on the floor up until 3 AM on Friday and Saturday, you can actually hear the after hour clubs until about 6 AM... just don't be surprised, they provide ear plugs or turn on the fan. It is not quite downtown at night, that is not the hotel's fault... they have legit thick soundproofing that keeps most the noise out, but the entire city is shaking from these clubs so that is the way of life."

Their resort fee which seems to have become a standard in the city provides you  two pints or glasses of wine, continental breakfast for each guest each day of your stay or a discount off the breakfast menu.  All of this and the quaint, coziness of the place will endear it to you "
"218557","97502","1","Keep in mind that there are excellent restaurants nearby, but you do have to pay good money for a taxi there and back. For instance, we went to The Cliff for one of the best seafood meals of my life ... well worth it ... but the taxi for the 15 minute ride there and back was $70."

The bathrooms weren’t the best design, and they seemed a bit run-down. Additionally, the pool was far from the rooms and the hot tub by the pool felt remote and uninviting. For the price, there are definitely better options. "

You can go to the beach but there are no chairs near the water and it is not built close to the water.  The hotel’s only focus is the pool. The flies are also pretty intense by the pool. And you can hear everyone having sex all day in other rooms. "

"218719","97568","1","Very disappointed by this experience. Worst Tablet hotel I have stayed at by far. My first day there I went to the pool around 8:30 am and most of chairs had towels and other items on them but no people. I left the area for a short while and since other people had commandeered the rest of the chairs, I left my stuff so I could return. However when I returned there was a person sitting in my chair and when I asked he where my stuff was she feigned ignorance. I went to try and find a hotel employee to talk to and found someone at the bar who said he had no idea what happened to my stuff. I had purchased 2 books and some some screen including a very expensive bottle I bought at the spa and a special hypoallergenic sun protection lotion for my face. As indicated in my other note, the manager did pay for a new lotion ultimately but they were not helpful and really made no effort to help with the situation. "

I preferred the one room which is what I would call a studio whit bed desk and sitting room all in one giant room with balcony. The no smoking seemed well adhered to which was nice. The metro is v easy to use and right at the door. I had no problem getting around. My Berlin friends were a bit horrified as this place is on a part Friedreichstraßer that could be anywhere in Europe but easy to get out and about to more Berlin feeling locations. "

"218939","97659","1","Loved , loved the property. It is so well maintained ( there is a handyman all day touching up the white interior everyday), the staff is amazing and extraordinary. The lounge /
bar really very cool and romantic. My only tip to any first time guests to the property is the road leading to hotel has a “discreet” signage and if you miss the fork it will take a long time for you to make a U turn due to one way/ narrow road. It is so worth it though. Also the road into the property is not for the faint hearted especially if you have a “largish” car . There is definitely a learning curve (no pun intended) to negotiate the sharp turns and the steep drop on one side . You have to take wide turns and plan on reversing at every turn . Better still get one of the wonderful staff members to do it for you, since it is a bit of  a challenge. The property also has a wonderful shuttle that they provide for the guests to take you into Positano which is also kudos to the property and fantastic so you don’t have to deal with the driving / parking which is at a premium all along the Amalfi Coast ."

Lots of slamming door noise in first room of suite just inside doorway, yet it was nice and dark for sleeping because no windows.  Only one bar of black soap, so bring your own or request more if you want an additional bar.  No mirror in queen room, so must go into king room for mirror if bathroom is occupied by other guest.  Can hear guests in room above, in hallway, and also through bathroom vent.  Call front desk to reserve table in patio for cocktails - they only do this for hotel desks.  Nice atmosphere but very expensive."

The hotel made up for this inconvenience, and our overall stay was pleasant, but it wasn't an auspicious start to the stay.

I will try to upload photos, it is absurd that this is a 5L. You arrive in a parking lot with no hotel personnel and you are welcomed by someone in a cave/parking that you have to just trust is the parking person. No one from the hotel was at the entrance, no one to help with luggages, open the doors, nothing. One person at reception dealing with everything."

2. You can skip the rain and traffic and take the S8 Sbahn from the airport and it drops you right at Marienplatz and it is a short block walk to the front door.

"221606","98769","1","Make sure you do not get a room near the elevator. The noise of the elevator woke us up at 5am. Also, unless you mind watching the person you are sharing the room with shower naked, probably not the best hotel. The bathroom wall is a piece of glass. "

"221730","98823","1","Be careful ! After you leave they charge your creditcard for purchases from the minibar. This is their regular procedure and as a routine absolutely OK. But they overcharged my card. I sent them 4 mails before I got an automated reply which said someone would contact me – but that did not happen.

My room was a two bedroomed suite and it adjoined a side service road. The window was open and could not be closed without a special tool ,that was not present and of course, at 8.30 in the morning when service personnel were wheeling trolleys past the window, I thought that room service were already in the room. No explanation about Tablet Plus benefits, so I assume that they had no objection to my drinking one of the two bottles of wine in the fridge as compensation for the lack of Champagne or Sake"

Even though our 6 year old daughter was looked after beautifully and was happy, there could be a few more fun things for kids...

"222409","99100","0","This is a great hotel. The location was perfect. There is a pedestrian walkway in front of the hotel that goes to the Acropolis. Don't even have to cross any streets. Breakfast was excellent. Only slight issue is that the rooms are fairly small; so you may want to get something bigger than the smallest rooms. My kids loved the hotel."

"222417","99103","1","The hotel is hardly in Jenner.  It's about 14 miles north of Jenner.  And it's 14 miles of curvy Highway 1 roads.  I'm a fan of these roads in a sports car, but it's worth knowing if you plan to drive to Jenner for dinner and then drive back to the inn....it will be dark, curvy, and sheer drop-off cliffs.  Also most of the activities listed are a bit of a hike - kayaking (1 hour drive ), oyster farms (90 min drive), wine country (2 hours), which is all fine, but it's not right there.  Still love this place. "

"222608","99183","0","Guests must know that there is no staff on-call 24 hours, and front desk closes around 9-9:30. So if you end up with a delayed flight, it is best to let the hotel know so they can tell you where to pick up keys.

But my biggest tip for this place is for light sleepers like myself: DON`T SLEEP IN CITY VIEW ROOMS. The building is located on a busy thoroughway and every time a truck or big car would go by, I could feel the room rock and shake. Furthermore, curtains here are not blackout so if sensitive to early sunlight do bring an eyemask."

It is fairly low-key, but I had a great espresso there for about 1.50 euro (probably the best coffee I've had in Paris). Order the Margarita Pizza from the hotel menu. If the flea markets are open you can walk there (it's not far from the hotel). No need for a plan you can just wander around. There are restaurants nearby too if you want to stop for lunch. I caught the train to the Louve, took approx. 25 mins door to door. "

Die Kombination aus hügeligen, grünen Rasenflächen mit jeder Menge Sitzplätzen um aufs Meer zu schauen, ist extrem gelungen.Es ist alles weitläufig und man hat Platz. Immer genug Liegen am Pool, der direkt am Meer liegt und auch am Strand. Angenehmes Publikum, sehr gemischte Nationalitäten und Altersgruppen. Der Strand ist einfach nur herrlich, jeden Tag anders, mal stille See, mal Wellen und Wind. Der Strand bietet sich für längere Spaziergänge an, ein paar Felsen zum Klettern gefielen unserer Tochter besonders gut. Der Sand ist nicht besonders fein, vielleicht nicht so toll zum Sandburgen bauen, dafür klebt er aber auch nicht an allem. Die Sonnenuntergänge mit einem Getränk auf derLiege oder iin der angrenzenden Strandbar, haben wir sehr genossen. Hier könnte man locker eine Woche verbringen, ohne die Anlage zu verlassen, wenn, ja leider gibt es dieses wenn, wenn da nicht der wirklich miese Service des Restaurantpersonals wäre. Da wir schon beim Frühstück so angenervt waren, dass es da so gar nicht funktioniert, haben wir uns das abends nicht antun wollen, Die Kellner sind leider einfach unaufmerksam und nicht wirklich motiviert. Die Hälfte der Tage mussten wir uns den Frühstückstisch selber mit Besteck eindecken, weil sie uns entweder ignorierten oder für 3 Personen dann nur zwei Bestecke usw brachten. Jeden Morgen bat ich um einen Salzstreuer, aus dem auch Salz kommt, den bekam ich dann entweder gar nicht oder bekam einen, der genauso verstopft war, wie der alte, einmal sagte mir ein Kellner, man müsse nur mal durch die Löcher durchspielen, als wenn ich da nicht schon selber drauf gekommen wäre. Schließlich haben wir uns einfach alles selber besorgt, was wir bräuchten und den Kontakt mit dem Personal auf ein absolutes Minimum beschränkt, dann ärgert man sich auch nicht. Das Frühstück an sich war gut, nettes Restaurant mit viel Platz u vielen Tischen auch draußen.Wir mussten nach einer Nacht unser Zimmer wech"

Don't count on it for a relaxing drink or even a slice of lower Manhattan...this is suburban pub crawl through and through. Which is a real bummer because when I went there was this totally fly DJ spinning vinyl who really knew her stuff and was creating a vibe that the crowd clearly did not appreciate. If I could have stomached the crowd I would have stayed.

In our view, the dinner experience included a couple of fantastic servings and the first two whites were truly wonderful, but the rest of the menu was really a big disappointment, not only in terms of food and wine, but also when it comes to service. Add to this a Russian oligarch at e central table bragging loudly about his wealth and Putin's fantastic reign. We are surprised that this restaurant still has three michelin stars. "

And we honestly weren't surprised. If it all possible, don't drive to this hotel, only use taxis and ride apps. It is on the River Walk up along a quiet part, halfway between the famous part and then the art museum and Pearl Brewery area up north, so we like the option to enjoy a 10+ minute quiet walk either direction."

"228194","101495","1","Just do not stay here if you're traveling for business.  I repeat- do not.  
I did not expect much in the terms of public space, but this hotel is truly like a glorified hipster hostel that is in desperate need of an update.  Internet was unusable it was so slow. 
 Could not work at all in hotel. While room was clean, I would definitely not stay again.
I was a single woman with a large suitcase for work appointments.  No elevator or anything on first floor - just immediate steps up to the 2nd floor.  Real problem for my work bag (hauling up and down).  My door had only the automatic lock in the door knob mechanism itself, and an old-school bar you close at the top once inside. Windows did not lock. I felt unsafe.  Walls are paper thin (can hear everything including low chatter next door), bed is uncomfortable, heat is not steady, no floor length mirror, no wardrobe.  Breakfast ... is funny.  Again, no usable internet.

If you're young and in Seattle to party or not spending any time whatsoever in the hotel, ok.  But then, make sure to request the Queen room with a private bathroom."

"228242","101514","1","Don't come here expecting a hotel experience, it's more of a bed and breakfast. There is no room service, or any food available anywhere except for breakfast. The room I was in was on the bottom floor and although it was large and nicely kept I found it to be really noisy due to street traffic, perhaps it's best to ask for a room on one of the higher floors."

It's perfect if you want to stay in a hip neighborhood without dealing with a lot of tourists."

The beach club is a bit of a messy situation, Takes a long time to get them to set up a chair for you even if there’s a lot of chairs available, closes at five, and if you need a beach umbrella they charge extra for that as well"

"228567","101652","1","The $100 tablet plus food/beverage credit can't be applied to room service, the mini bar, or alcohol, so treat yourself to the phenomenal breakfast once or twice.  Otherwise, the restaurant - while quite good - is extremely expensive for Seoul.

Also be aware that the hotel has a kind of strange layout:  You'll take an elevator from the ground floor to the 24th floor lobby, and from there need to switch elevators to go down to your room.  Never bothered us, but I suppose it's worth noting if for some reason you happen to really hate 1) elevators or 2) having to say a friendly hello to the desk staff 2-3x per day."

"228648","101687","1","They have closed the (allegedly) great bar as well as the restaurant for renovations. None of this was disclosed when booking. So until April 2020 when they say they will be complete the place is compromised and we were disappointed. "
"228651","101688","1","Best to stay somewhere else.  It was awful, except for the cute diner downstairs (food only mediocre, though)."
"228656","101690","1","Maybe ask for a room that doesn't face the main road.  Otherwise, staff is great and the room was very clean."

"228664","101693","1","One thing, based on the pictures on Tablet, one would think the hotel had a pool. It does not. The large ""pool"" in the photos is actually a hot tub with a very shallow adjacent area, sort of like a place to lounge in the water. It's often hot in Zona Cafetera and a pool would have been nice. "
"228667","101694","1","Our room was right below the rooftop restaurant/bar which seems to be the “It” place in Bogota right now, and although we could hear the sound a bit, it wasn’t too bothersome. There’s only one XL room per floor and we were on the highest floor with rooms, a small view of the city and mountains, but mostly the view was of the office building next door. On a lower floor, the XL room would probably not have any view at all. The L rooms, a bit smaller, overlook the street and may have nicer views.

"228753","101728","1","Get breakfast!  It's tasty."
"228756","101729","1","Don’t expect a typical hotel but rather a luxury guesthouse or “guest-home” located in an imposing bourgeois high end Roman building, The location is perfect, less than a minute from Piazza di Popolo, five minutes from the Spanish steps. 
My room was smaller than expected from the pictures but it didn’t really matter, but if you’re travelling as a couple make sure to ask for a bigger one!

"228814","101753","1","Do not stay here!  The pictures online are deceiving.  The rooms are terrible:  the wallpaper is peeling, the rugs are dirty, the lights in the bathrooms don't work, and the room smells like a locker room.

Only 1 iron and ironing board the board was broken so you had to lay it on the floor and iron. On the second day they advised to iron on the bed. No hot water in the shower, outdoor pool/tub maintenance was unable to let out the water so we could fill with new water. No ice, taxis had a hard time finding the location. Once we arrived we were charged 200 more than total we received from Tablet, front desk claimed it was takes but the same taxes were on the tablet email confirmation.  I mean I can keep going and going. Horrible do not waste your time or money. "

Morning walk around the island! 

BBQ shack was our favorite restaurant! 

Lunch - we asked the chef to make us local and Indian style curries for in room dining lunches, which isn’t on the menus. Great call! Let them do their thing!

There is still noise overhead from the loud music they are playing at the rooftop restaurant and bar from early to late, which you will definitely hear if you do not bring a speaker to play some kind of white noise or in my case ocean sounds. I would prefer that loudness to the loudness coming from the street and the parking lots.

! - book activities (both resort and off-resort) as early as possible as things get booked up fast and you can end up with little or no choice for activities if you don't book until you arrive onsite. 
2 - there were a lot of very young kids at the resort, which I was not expecting given the price point of the rooms.

Also, check with the spa on the fine details of treatments like the massage. I had a pre-natal massage and didn't realize it would be a side-lying massage vs. with pre-natal equipment (like massage wedges). 

Lastly, consider staying during the week - it was pretty quiet, peaceful, and we got to know the servers well. Apparently, the hotels book up quickly with weddings so you can avoid that hullabaloo by staying during the week. "

We checked out 2 days before because we were very disappointed. No fridge either. I don’t think I ever stayed in a place that don’t provide a small fridge.

"234170","103978","1","We used the hotel’s car service for arrival which was comparable to the price of an Uber.  It was a nice option since we arrived early and made it a seamless arrival process. The hotel is tucked away on a short pedestrian street so it could be difficult to explain to a driver if they are unfamiliar with the maze of streets in this area. "

"234223","103998","1"," It is packed with young families on the weekends which is awesome if you are ready for it. They do wonderful things for kids and adults alike.  It is also a little noisy - but you are in LA - a big city. I recommend a room facing the parking lot for quiet. Pool facing rooms are louder; but, have. nicer view.   Try the Humus. it is amazing.  The bartenders are just wonderful.  I have stayed here three times while visiting my son in Burbank.  Easy back road commute to Burbank.  "
"234226","103999","1","This hotel sits across the street from the Interior Ministry of Spain so there's 24/7 police surveillance on the street. Not the most relaxing and quite uncomfortable to be honest. We also had limited food and housekeeping service because August everyone goes on holiday and there was limited staff available servicing the guests (as told upon check in). Unfortunately won't stay here again. More of a business hotel rather than enjoying on holiday establishment."
"234229","104000","1","Make sure to plan your meals as they have to be eaten or procured off-premises. But equally, do schedule time for enjoying the incredible grounds and pool!"
"234232","104001","1","This is not a reflection on the quality of the hotel, but guests should be aware that the neighborhood surrounding the hotel appears to have really deteriorated (I stay in the Union Square/Nob Hill area every year or so).  The streets within a block of the hotel seem to have been taken over by the homeless, with urine smell, tents, cardboards and trash everywhere.  It wouldn't be so concerning if it weren't for the fact that during our 4-day stay at the hotel, we were accosted 3 times by seemingly drunk or psychotic homeless individuals within a block of the hotel.  Each incident passed without violence, thank goodness, but it was unsettling. "

"234788","104233","1","Don’t make a cocktail in the minibar unless you’re ready to pay full price for the bottles! Breakfast was complimentary but I would have it elsewhere if you’re a breakfast person. Reserve a spot on the rooftop - it’s super cute. "
"234793","104235","1","kids can not be by the pool after 12pm and the rooms are comfortable and have a kitchenette but small and very ordinary, definitely in need of a window treatment update so if you want to spend a lot of time in your room this is not the hotel for you."

A l'arrivée à la réception, nous demandons la possibilité de réserver une table au rooftop. On a dû le redemander le lendemain, sans jamais avoir eu de retour. Le deuxième soir, nous voulons commander des cocktails en chambre, il était impossible car le bar était fermé pour cause de pluie. Chose curieuse que nous n'avons jamais vécu dans d'autres hôtels au même nombre d'étoiles. 
Pour le petit déjeuner en chambre facturé 25€/personne, on était limité à un pancake par personne et un oeuf, chose ridicule comptant le coût des matières premières.
Et enfin, nous croisions souvent des vaisselles sales de room service abandonnées dans les couloirs, un délice.
Pour ceux qui viendraient en voiture: l'hôtel ne dispose pas de parking, le plus proche étant celui du Pharo. On nous le conseille sans nous préciser que le tarif est de 35 euros la journée.

The hotel is located in a horrible part of Manhattan; I grew up in NYC, so I knew this going into my stay, but even still, I was really put off by the surrounding environs. The city's homelessness / opioid crises are basically on your front step as the Port Authority, countless halfway houses, and Penn Station are so close. The second problem are the guests that this hotel seems to attract. The proximity to Times Square invites revelers who return to the hotel loudly and drunkenly at all hours. Every single night of my stay I was awoken by other guests getting off the elevator singing, screaming, or having loud conversations. One night, the room next door to mine had a party that lasted until 5:30 am and only stopped when security came up to the room. It's worth paying an additional $30 - $50 a night at a nicer / better located hotel in order to be able to sleep."

As for the hotel, well... we read the bad reviews here, and came to stay here for two nights anyway because sometimes reviewers are wrong, and it seemed like a very good establishment in a very good location on paper. In reality, the hotel is bad - a 3 stars ranking would be very kind. The bad reviews are right: the rooms are worn out, the furniture, showers, windows and entrainment system are old, the rooms are small and lack any characteristic of a 5-star hotel room (other than the expensive mini-bar, of course). There is no real reception, and the staff is non-existent: all service and technical support is managed by three girls in the reception, lost and inexperienced and lack any capability to either offer high standard of service or to contain the flow of guests. This is not a coincidence - it seems like a method of the hotel to maintain a 5 star façade at the expense of the guests who fell into the trap and already paid. 
We wrote them a very lengthy email about how bad was the experience, they did not even bother to reply and apologize. A very rude, privileged, arrogant and extremely lacking establishment. Our first two nights in Vienna were ruined. "

"236839","105078","1","THINK TWICE BEFORE BOOKING THIS HOTEL

As mentioned, I have stayed hear multiple times over the past decade and this last stay was frustrating to say the least.  The staff are extremely friendly but sadly that doesn't make up for what must be under investment in the facilities.  During a week long stay, there was always one if not two elevator banks not working.  So that usually added 10 minutes onto every morning routine to get out of the hotel.  

The room I was in during the second half of my stay clearly hadn't seen a maintenance person in years.  The bed was lumpy - there was a good 1 inch height difference from one side of the mattress to the other.  The walls were stained and the window curtains are also discolored.  There were a few other minor points as well.

And while the hotel addressed most of the room issues over the course of my stay, I don't feel like I should have to manage maintenance for this place.

I usually spend upwards of 30 nights a year in NY hotels.  I like the Standard's location but am going to be staying elsewhere from now on."

Because these businesses must appeal to locals the quality is excellent and prices are surprisingly affordable.  This is a very different Paris than what exists in the areas that are more dependent on tourism, and if you love Paris you will love this part the most.   If you are in Paris to go to the theatre like I was, there are many great options within walking distance. "

But White Water has a great bar lounge and serves wonderful appetizers in the evenings, and tasty breakfast fare in the mornings (they don't have a restaurant but if they ever do I expect it would be amazing). But, the picnic baskets with fresh baked goods and delicious coffee delivered to your room each morning may entice you to forego a public breakfast in the lounge. For dinner, the Sea Chest restaurant down the street is a must-try experience, but go at 5:30pm and put your name on the list for the 7pm seating - otherwise you'll be waiting in line for an hour plus and might not get in. But for really amazing food, plan for an early dinner in Paso Robles (Les Petites Canailles was amazing) or San Luis Obispo (Nates on Marsh was pretty decent too). It's about 30-45 minutes each way to each town - but worth it for excellent food and wine tasting.  "

Do take a swimsuit and kaftan to be culturally appropriate as most local people swim in shorts and t-shirts. You may feel more comfortable. Just be aware that Kiwengwa is a relatively built-up stretch of beach but that seems to be the case around most of the island and obviously beyond Mvuvi's control! "

"237647","105407","1","Barbieri review

If you hope to have a wonderful stay at the eternal city of Rome, in a 4 star hotel- this is not it.

This is a hostel at a central location - at best. 

The reception, concierge and staff is bare bones of one person if any during the day. Their helpfulness is a luck of the draw. A manager does not exist.

Any amenities and services such as food or laundry are not offered although advertised otherwise. 

The rooms seem large and spare but so is the bed. Expect rough cotton sheets that don’t cover the bed properly, hard log pillows to put your weary head on and the cacophonous chorus of the starling birds nested in the tree at the back of the building throughout the night (millions of them during the winter migration). 

Don’t be fooled by the promised views, images of hip rooms nor the ceiling fresco. Avoid at all costs.

There’s no minibar or coffee station in the room, which I didn’t know I needed till I stayed in a hotel room without it (haha)! You’ll also have to step out for coffee and food since the restaurant (thence the room service) is open for breakfast/brunch only from Wednesday through Sunday, and for dinner from Tuesday through Sunday, all during limited hours. There’s self-service coffee and water bottles in the lobby for about 2 hours in the AM.  "

It is near a pretty good selection of restaurants, but the one they sent me to was full, so you'd think they would facilitate some reservations for their guests or at least help with some other suggestions. Nope, I had to explore on my own, which isn't terrible, but it's not very helpful, and I know what I like to eat so it would be pretty easy to recommend a place I'd like."

"237890","105507","1","Be prepared to not always have room service available and the restaurant isn’t always open. Other than that the location is great and hotel is clean and feels very out of the way and quite. Def isn’t an upbeat atmosphere. "
"237901","105512","1","If you’re a very deep sleeper and you’re not too picky about where you stay, then this place might be okay for you. Beware, pictures are very deceiving. It feels very much like a budget hotel. "

"237913","105516","1","It's important to note that Tarraleah is located in a remote location in central Tasmania. Depending on your provider you may or may not receive much mobile phone reception on the way to or while at Tarraleah. Wifi was available and fast enough for our needs. Also, flies and insects are omnipresent during the hotter months both around the outdoor areas of the site but especially on the walking tracks - bring insect repellent and don't be surprised if they want to share your picnic lunch. Finally, the water from the taps isn't potable, but bottled drinking water is provided in ample quantity. The water in the bath/spa also runs slightly brown - it didn't bother us but it may be offputting to some."

"237941","105527","1","The Beach Huts that are 10 feet tall are lovely and private. The little deck with the daybed allows you to lay down and listen to the gentle cacophony of crickets and frogs and, if you are lucky, rainfall. Nothing more relaxing than that combo. Kayaking around the lagoon to get a good look at other villas is a fun way to explore. And you can ask for a guide/driver to take you into town to check out the local scene and get a bit more of an idea about Jamaica outside the luxurious bubble of the resort. "

But.....you are right across the street from the Ritz and the Marriot which has all of that.  So it’s just a short jaunt across the street.  Included in the Marriott is a Ruth Chris Steak house, which was really awesome if you like meat.  And there are small kitchens in each unit so you can also buy food for you room."

"238641","105814","1","Make sure you ask for a room on the second floor, otherwise you will hear footsteps, noises. "

Pas du grand luxe mais du super sympa comme on aime :) "

"238650","105817","1","There is a ski rental shop in the hotel that will equip you with everything you need for a day of skiing, but you should arrange for a private ski instructor to take you around the several mountains in the area that all operate under the same ski pass. Don't miss the opportunity to ski the glacier on Les Diablerets, which is a 20 minute drive away. The hotel is on a bus route, so you don't even need to take your car to get to some of the ski mountains.

"238657","105820","1","If you're a light sleeper, probably better off choosing another hotel."
"238662","105822","0","It’s worth it to book the nearby Pelham, long our Tablet choice in London. "
"238669","105825","1","I thought that the hotel would be better than the  website.  What you see is what you get.  Do not recomend this hotel, even the Uber drivers wondered why we had chosen this &quot;bizarre hotel&quot;
 Check in took us aroung 40 minutes because they could't find the Tablet reservation."
"238676","105828","1","Restaurant and bar are especially fun. 
Perfect margaritas."
"238689","105834","0","Overnight parking is very convenient since the garage is under the hotel."

"238701","105839","1","- not worth the money"
"238708","105842","1","This is an expensive hotel to stay at for at least one night but it has one of highest praises from the Michelin restaurant guide for the state of Utah.  The food is terrific  for both adventurous and non adventurous eaters.  The rooms except the suites a were smaller than I expected like any regular hotel but are a bit nicer than regular hotel rooms anywhere else. "
"238713","105844","1","Ask for a room with a fireplace. Make sure there is not a wedding or function as things were crowded and some of the bar rooms closed."
"238722","105848","1","Ask for courtyard view"
"238727","105850","0","Book one of the higher room categories (loft or king with sofa bed) if you want any kind of space; the king rooms (even the ones with good views) are some of the smallest I've stayed in. Pack light, no one will help you with bags."

"238747","105859","1","Valet is the only option in this location! "
"238754","105862","1","I would recommend looking elsewhere given the nightly price at Villa Royale.  We were also put in an annex building (across the street and down a couple hundred yards) that wasn't even attached to the main property that is shown in the pictures.  An overall disappointing experience, and we checked out and switched hotels after only one night.  Not what I would expect from a Tablet hotel. "
"238763","105866","0","If your looking for something luxurious, thoughtful and something individually this is not the place. "
"238768","105868","1","Don’t go there. Rooms are with mold. The smell of the mold is everywhere. The sheets and towels smell so bad. The pool is ridiculous. The area is so noisy, and it comes to your rooms, also it impossible to get to the hotel by car because the city is closing the streets and it's even worse in the evening because they're enlarging the radius of the shutdown and you need to walk for so long from where the taxi will drop you. The Gym is surprisingly close, which is also super disappointing - nobody ofcoursevlet us know about it. The rooms dosen't have a window! And the are all facing the lobby which is the worth when the room Smell so badly. Lack of privacy when everyone can see you in your room from just walking in the lobby. I will never recommend it to anyone "
"238775","105871","1","Super convenient distance to the Airport, no need to rush there hours in advance."
"238780","105873","1","Bring crisp cash for taxi's and transport.  Some of our USD was a bit worn and the drivers didn't want anything &quot;bendy&quot;.  So pack some fresh cash as it was the only thing we were unprepared for. "
"238789","105877","1","The entrance is super hidden and you will think that you are not at the right place.    The inside is great but the neighborhood is quite concerning. "
"238792","105878","1","Pay attention to artwork and photos throughout the hotel. Lots of hidden surprises. "
"238795","105879","1","If you can afford it, the Club Suites are very nice, but very expensive too. "

"238837","105897","1","Don’t book it "
"238840","105898","1","I would only stay here if you need a place specifically in Round Rock. If you are spending most of your day in Austin, it is not worth the trek and you won’t get to enjoy the hotel’s amenities. "
"238843","105899","1","Simply accept using the code to get in at night - you don't need the owner coming out in his pyjamas!"
"238858","105906","1","Driving to the hotel can be quite harrowing in bad weather and the road to the hotel is not very well maintained. We counted 4 cars that were either stuck or had gone off the road as we left the hotel."
"238867","105910","1","Get the staff to arrange a day trip to Coralina Island. You’ll get put on a boat for an hour-long trip out of the bay to a small private island. There will be reserved loungers for you under trees overlooking a turquoise sea. You can snorkel, swim, read, drink, whatever. It’s a six hour stay that flies by. $60 per person plus whatever you eat and drink (food isn’t as good as what you’ll get in the city, but it’s passable)."
"238872","105912","1","Consider staying at other places, unless you you’re looking for a Spring Break experience."
"238879","105915","1","rooms on the beach are great, the rest is a real disaster and truly overpriced. "

"238913","105930","1","There are better places all over Firenze in the center for just a bit more of a spend. Do not stay here unless price is your only consderation. "
"238916","105931","1","Look for another hotel where you may spend a bit more, but the level of comfort will be far superior. "
"238919","105932","1","It's worth paying more for a high floor that faces the hills!"
"238922","105933","1","This is not a very good hotel. I was consistently disappointed. It is convenient for skiing. I would not stay here for any other reason, and I would think about alternative hotels (although not sure if there are any) if going for a ski trip to Stowe."
"238933","105938","1","This is one of those hotels that look nicer in photos than in person.  Still decent but not for the price we paid."

"238981","105957","1","Selma Street is abysmal in terms of homeless people living there, I had to walk past tent encampments, turds, people passed out on the street right next to the hotel. Did not feel safe at night or even daytime walking there alone. "
"238984","105958","1","There is no room service. "
"238987","105959","1","Guests should know this resort is a corporate playground. When we were there reception was constantly packed with new groups checking in and they dominated the entire experience with various functions happening all over the resort, day and evening. There was then a wedding at the weekend. All fine but the description should not be that it’s quiet "
"238990","105960","1","Check to see if they have food service because tablet hotel does not let you know it . 
No room service , no food for 2/3 days/ nights "

"239013","105970","1","Rooms are small and won’t dazzle but are clean and very comfortable."
"239016","105971","1","Ask the concierge for their restaurant recommendations. Be sure to check out the sister hotel Urban for a rooftop tapas or cocktail! "
"239019","105972","1","If you pre-pay for Breakfast, you will find a really nice selection of food. Book early for the best rates. "
"239022","105973","1","The hotel has character (despite service we experienced being awful) but this isn't a hotel I would expect to find on Tablet"
"239029","105976","1","Sea - disappointingly far from clear and with seaweeds, although we still enjoyed it, maybe it is just this time of year (March)
Try other hotels while here - our experience was that price/value ratio was far better in many"
"239032","105977","1","Dunton is very remote. Bring shoes that can get muddy and be prepared for the very rustic hot springs.  We enjoyed the friendly staff with service that is attentive but not overly so. Our cabin was cozy and well appointed. Not much to do onsite, so be prepared to just relax. Meals were good; one menu option only for both lunch and dinner though I believe they accommodate food allergies and dislikes. Overall, nice but very pricey stay for a couple of days. "
"239037","105979","1","Dont prefer the rooms upstair"

"239088","106001","1","amazing location!"
"239091","106002","1","The hotel is not exactly in Selfoss and transportation can be challenging. 

The bar/lounge behind the discreet door is not to be missed."
"239098","106005","1","So come knowing that you will stay in a beautiful place but don't expect the service you get in other hotels that call themselves luxury hotels."

"239190","106045","0","Don't accept a top floor room."
"239193","106046","1","Get a room with a view - very nice"
"239196","106047","1","If you are not familiar with the hotel and arrive late at night it can be confusing as so how to get your luggage into the hotel, there is no one at the door. Also no room service menu for food in the evening. Also they do not make your room, you have to request to have your room made, there is a small card on the side of the bed- I missed that last time and forgot to ask this time, was annoying when I came back to the room. Rooms are also really small, not really anywhere to store your luggage. All the staff are really nice at the desk, I had great service from Jay"
"239201","106049","1","Highly recommend this hotel overall. We ended our 1-month of Costa Rican travels here. I am grateful I got to stay in such a beautiful location and experience such luxury. However, this hotel will not give you the real experience of Costa Rica. Recommend combining this stay with a stay elsewhere off the peninsula for a more local experience."
"239206","106051","1","Each room/suite is different. Some have indoor hot tubs, other outdoors. The rooms around the pool are a little dark. The newer section, above the restaurant has the best rooms.
Book your airport transfers with the hotel - they provided a luxury car at a reasonable price."
"239213","106054","1","Just book something else"
"239218","106056","1","Ask for rooms #17 or #8 for an ocean view; make plans for breakfast if you want more than a pastry or two (and plenty of mimosas). "
"239227","106060","1","Rooms are on the small side. More of a specialty motel. Not a lot of frills that are standard at bigger, more established hotels. Not sure it it was worth the price, ultimately. "
"239230","106061","1","Book in advance to get a room! "
"239233","106062","1","Very good location "
"239238","106064","1","Laisser la porte des toilettes ouverte pour qu'elle se rechauffe elle n'est pas réchauffée et très froide. "
"239241","106065","1","The front desk staff are better at guiding airport transfer plans than any online or app resource I could find. Have a drink at the bar. "
"239254","106071","1","If you're looking for life and energy it's a fabulous choice. It's a little tricky to find quiet spots for work or rest. Even the pool is in the middle of the party."
"239269","106078","1","The wine was decent and made the other small details less of an issue for my one night. "
"239272","106079","1","Very non Vegas. Nice vibe basically. Chill. "
"239275","106080","1","The rooms with terraces are lovely."

"239326","106102","1","A single room means a twin size bed with almost no space. Felt like a dorm room but a 3rd of the size. Stains on the carpet. "
"239333","106105","1","Very close to museums and a tram stop is directly outside of the hotel."
"239336","106106","1","The 24/7 honor system sundries store and ice cream chest are a delight. "
"239341","106108","1","You must know that the street/ area is a party area! There are tons of cars, pedestrians, restaurants, shops and clubs. It's not a standalone hotel - it's a luxurious oasis among chaos. "

Grab a drink at the bar.  Very cozy and relaxing."
"239452","106155","1","This is no fault of the hotel, but keep in mind SOHO is a pretty far taxi or Uber ride to places like the Met and Times Square (if you’re seeing a show). Keep that in mind. Uber prices were crazy when we were there because of subway shooting. We didn’t feel comfortable taking train. There’s plenty to do in SOHO and close neighborhoods though. "
"239455","106156","1","Don't be too tall. You literally have to lower your head to get to the 7th floor. The same for the bathroom. Bad experience for the price! I paid 230 euros for a night!"
"239462","106159","1","This is a sharp-looking, not-kid-friendly hotel in a fun but marginal stretch of a major avenue. No gym, limited breakfast and other food service, limited parking are minuses; fun decor is a plus. It's ok; probably there are better options."
"239471","106163","1","Bring earplugs. This feels like a heavily used airbnb apartment."

"239535","106189","1","I believe it is more money but a short walk away is The Four Seasons. Just as nice a location, much more helpful staff and very much more creative in their offerings.

"240815","106710","1","This hotel has been overrated. We had a mixed experience. My ratings would be dismal on day #1 but substantially improved afterwards, as I explain this below.

We arrived a bit before 3pm and had to wait, so the front desk advised us to get a coffee in their bar. We left our luggages in the waiting area, no one offered to take care of them. We asked if we cold stay one more night. Then we were told the room was ready and we could stay for one more night. We had to pay in advance for the 4 nights, without seeing our room. Agreeing was in fact a mistake as the room was on the top floor, very small indeed, about 7.5 feet high, and the king bed became a full bed. Later we learned that the room was in the area where hotel personnel also rent their rooms. It was really a no issue that L'Occitane cosmetics were switched to a local brand (Highland Soap Co., lemongrass &amp; ginger, BTW not bad at all). We shared our disappointment about the room with the front desk and that was that.

Next day we returned to the room and found that the faint smell we suspected the day before became strong and it was indeed a sewer smell. When we told this to another lady at the front desk, she moved us right away into a larger room with sea view, which saved our stay at Oban. 

The hotel has old floor-to-floor carpeting throughout, and squeaks quite a bit. The windows do not isolate very well. The place seems to be in need for renovation.

It seems there is a great deal of complacency as the hotel is always busy and there is really no motivation to better serve the guests."

Unfortunately it also had broken air conditioning; the hotel was kind enough to upgrade us as an apology for this. The refurbished rooms are a *huge* improvement - night and day, really. Therefore, I would strongly recommend paying the modest extra amount for these better rooms."

"242269","107303","1","My vision for this trip was a Southern France getaway (i.e. beaches, coastal, relaxed). Monaco is well situated to travel to the many beautiful towns of Southern France (there is a very convenient train), but its vibe is a bit different from its neighbors.

Monaco is glitzy, energetic, and more commercialized. It's a beautiful city and I would recommend this hotel, which was excellent, as a great way to explore it, but if you are looking for quaint French Riviera and time along the coast, I recommend considering a hotel in Cap-D'Ail, Beauliea-Sur-Mer, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, or Villefranche-Sur-Mer. 

If you are looking for a lively atmosphere, high end brands, and a unique nightlife, Monaco is perfect. "

"242342","107331","1","The room we were in had two little stairs going up to a living room area on the way to the bathroom. This proved rather dangerous in the middle of the night. The other thing was that the lights were on a motion sensor so they turned on full force in the middle of the night, as well if someone had to get up. Also, we had to take the elevator all the time...They said there were no stairs we could use. "
"242349","107334","1","Let the front desk folks help you make plans, because they're really good at it. Their experience and connections should be leveraged, and you'll benefit from both. They can help with dinner and activity suggestions, ideas, and reservations. If you're going to take the Gap of Dunloe tour (I highly recommend you do, because you won't believe what you see), make sure to book ahead: trips usually leave from the hotel by 10:00 am and fill up fast. Also, plan on seeing the Muckross House inside the park, and if you get a chance, take a boat ride, which you can catch over at the boathouse. Don't look for Uber to get you around if you don't feel like walking (Killarney is very walkable). Killarney is a taxi town, and there are lots of great options to choose from on that front (Flemings and the Killarney Cab Co. were the two we used). Flemings actually had a driver drive us back to Dublin (a 3.5 hour trip) at 5:00 in the morning to catch a flight at noon. They were amazing and really easy to work with.
One other thing: the rooms aren't air-conditioned, but that shouldn't be a problem, because it cools off nicely at night. 
Enjoy your stay...Killarney is a wonderful place! "

"242567","107423","1","When checking in, be sure to ask for the “plus” perks - they will not just give them to you, and they are of real benefit in this hotel.  

Also, for some reason the front of house staff are quite useless.  They are pleasant and seem helpful - but nothing actually happens!  I was there for a week and several times they failed to deliver messages, make in-house restaurant bookings etc.  Quite disappointing. "

"242628","107449","1","We booked an Extra Large Room which was quite spacious and had a great view of the Acropolis (406 by memory).  Fortunately we booked at reception for drinks on the roof terrace and dinner in the food hall because both were quite busy."

"242649","107457","1","Book the day before for transport if you want to go to one of the 3 “private beaches” (beach clubs). The one with sand booked out fast. The other ones were nice as well. Worth doing. Isola bella is the public free beach and is beautiful, but it is VERY crowded, so beach club for us was the way to go. You get an umbrella, towels, and bar and food available for purchase. "
"242656","107460","1","Book the restaurant in advance because they don't give priority to hotel guests, go early to pool to save good seats (they run out) and ask for a renovated room. I had a really hard time sleeping in the older room because I could hear everything from my neighbors."
"242659","107461","1","Make sure you're OK with no closet (the hotel is open-concept closet, which means there are rods on the wall, and that's where you hang your clothes) and no bed furniture (the mattress is on the floor)."
"242662","107462","1","Check if the construction of road is finished, it makes a bit harder to drive in."

"242668","107464","1","The neighborhood has so many great finds - just stroll!"
"242671","107465","1","Overall being outside of the city and surrounded by the Iceland tundra is worth the drive. Getting to and from the international airport is only 20 additional minutes versus going to Reykjavik."

"242714","107483","1","The hotel is located at the edge of the Omonia neighborhood which is quite sketchy, especially at night. Our first night we made the mistake of walking north deep into Omonia and saw tons homeless people with crack pipes, hanging out or sleeping on the streets. We were ready to leave Athens early but then discovered that pretty much every neighborhood just south of the hotel is lively, hip, safe and super fun. "
"242721","107486","1","definitely stay here but make your own restaurant reservations. "
"242724","107487","1","Prefer rooms with tank or sea view..."

"242751","107498","1","Book the Superior room! It’s so unique and special. "
"242758","107501","1","This is a very small hotel.  Do not expect big lobbies, restaurants, room service, etc.  "

"242794","107517","1","there's only stairs. If you have big bags request the 1st floor. however if you dont have big bags then request a higher floor further from the music in the bar. "
"242797","107518","1","The view from the rooftop bar alone is worth the stay but most importantly it’s the people who run the hotel."
"242800","107519","1","Likely a great hotel for a weekend bachelorette party. If looking for anything with a standard in high quality or luxury - I might go up the street a few blocks. 

Staff seemed lovely - and did try. The facility needs a pretty big upgrade."
"242807","107522","1","This hotel is nicely situated and quietly set back from the busy street. The rooms are comfortable, fairly well sized, and particularly clean. Easy access on foot to many of the beautiful city attractions, and a few small convenience stores and cafés are right next door (no continental breakfast available). "
"242814","107525","1","Recommend to eat at hotel restaurant!"
"242819","107527","1","If you can overlook the significant wear and tear and general grimy feel of the room then this is your spot. "
"242824","107529","0","While there is a &quot;buzzy vibe&quot; from the restaurant and bar until they close, the rest of the night was really quiet and peaceful."
"242829","107531","1","Nicht buchen. "
"242832","107532","1","Lovely hotel. Bring your own hair conditioner. Due to the old building type noise travels easily, consider ear plugs. "
"242837","107534","1","Single room was actually great for one person!  Really charming, 5th floor had a view of the courtyard and rooftops.  It was like my own  tiny garret.  Hotel is not really family friendly (which was great for me). "
"242842","107536","1","If you have a reservation at Hotel Santa Caterina,
I advise you to spend at least one whole day just at the hotel , enjoying the sea, the pool, including your lunch and dinner. "
"242853","107541","1","Don’t stay here unless you are comfortable with the location- unsafe at night"
"242858","107543","1","It’s worth upgrading to a bigger room if the additional cost is minimal. "

"242866","107546","1","Definitely walk down to galley beach at the end of the road  for a sunset cocktail- we did this both nights and throughly enjoyed it (we didn’t reserve a table but it is recommended). Our best dinner in town was the nautilus- you can book a table 7 days in advance."
"242869","107547","1","Chambre agréable et accueil parfait "
"242872","107548","1","So many other hotels in LA and even Venice, stay somewhere else.

"242877","107550","1","--Don't expect an upgrade
--Slow elevator
--Continental breakfast included until 10 AM
--Great view from roof deck w/ chairs but no amenities"
"242886","107554","1","We were given the back rooms on the top floor. Avoid these as they are very hot and the windows don’t open fully. The air conditioning is ancient and makes rattling noise. "
"242891","107556","1","The pool is excellent and has a great view. Locally for coffee try Sarnies around the corner."
"242894","107557","1","The hotel is a bit out of the main area so either settle in and relax or expect to use Grab a bit"
"242897","107558","1","Best local coffee at Roast8ry Lab just around the corner - Melbourne level coffee. Otherwise get a room facing the street, higher up if possible."
"242900","107559","1","Unfortunately the main problem was the location. This is hard to fix.

The location is pretty uninteresting and industrial. There is not much to do around unless you have come for the exhibition center. 


The roof has a nice deck but they had loud music on, so it was not a good place for me to sit, read or relax. 

The description suggested that we would feel the rocking of the hotel as it is on a platform. But the hotel doesn't move. "
"242903","107560","1","The European breakfast (that's included) is why I keep coming back. Delightful as always. "
"242906","107561","1","Vous pouvez avoir une confiance aveugle dans le personnel! Ils sont à l’écoute, tout ce qu’on attend dans un hôtel!"
"242911","107563","1","Be aware that the Israeli hospitality during the meal service is not what one would expect for such a deluxe hotel. Other than the meal experience it was amazing."

Before Amalfu, you reach to Pontone, you can stop there, have a drink rest a little bit and continue trekking down to Amalfi."
"242946","107577","1","There is a bar on the same street that blasts loud music on weekends. It did not bother us because we had to stay up to go to the airport anyways. The Craft Shop next door also has a nice garden cafe/wine bar. "
"242957","107582","1","Make reservations ahead of time for the rooftop! It gets packed early, and hard to get a table"

"242963","107584","1","Rooftop is great for snacks and drinks and sunbathing and dipping in the pool during the day, then transforms into a hip nightclub vibe at night! You can see Casa Mila and Sagrada Familia from the roof."
"242966","107585","1","Don’t wear high heals or carry a suitcase on wheels, the streets are very narrow and made of small uneven stones. Not all taxi drivers know how to get close to the hotel so you may have to walk a bit."

"243001","107599","1","Use the plus benefits and book a master suite. The plus benefits will upgrade you to the Alan suite, which is truly special! 
The breakfast is very tasty, and there is a champagne / oyster happy hour which is worth a look. "
"243004","107600","1","Enjoy a most restful and well-served stay at this gem of a hotel in Amsterdam’s bustling and historic Jordann district. It is easy to find and travel to and from, yet it is out of the way enough to provide you a very restful stay during your visit to Amsterdam."
"243011","107603","1","Not my idea of a Tablet hotel. Under par. "
"243014","107604","1","Buy water and snacks in the Monop really close by. "

"243073","107626","1","Get a room abit far from the wooden stairs as some guests are too noisy when going up/down"
"243080","107629","1","Rooms are very small"
"243087","107632","1","Be sure to inquire about upgrades and ask about seeing room in advance.  First upgrade choice was just ok.  Second choice when we expressed disappointment was fantastic."
"243090","107633","1","Restaurant on the top floor has an amazing view over the city but is basically a nightclub with a bar area overlooking the dinning tables. Lots of first dates going on and raucous music coming from the bar. You will want to research other dining opportunities if you have your family with you. "
"243093","107634","1","The elevators to reception are all the way at the end and to the left, so you have to make your way through the crowd at the bar to check in. The front door doesn't have a pull in area, so dropping off and picking up is a challenge. The rooftop dinning room is a night club in the evening with  DJ and a combination of indoor and outdoor space. Views are terrific, and reservations are necessary. Breakfast in the morning is a very good buffet, but  you know that you are not in a space designed for that purpose, so it's a bit awkward and you feel a bit left out if you weren't there a few hours before grinding to the music with your friends. The hallways where the rooms are located are black and there is very little lighting. Again, think of this as a nightclub with rooms. "
"243096","107635","0","You may think you have made a wrong turn when you first drive up as it looks like an office building campus, but press on and when you get to the front door the staff will emerge to help you in. The hotel is on a golf course, and there is a lot of golf tourism, so your fellow guests will all look like they are going to or returning from 18 holes. Golf bags are lined up like soldiers outside the front door in the morning, and vans are outside ready to deploy the troops. "
"243099","107636","1","The concierges are very knowledgeable, so take advantage of their skills to help you plan your day around Amsterdam. They gave us the name of a great tapas restaurant I would never have found on my own where we had the best food and experience. LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE CROSSING THE STREET, and watch out for bicycles or they will run you over. "
"243102","107637","0","A great hotel can be a little intimidating at times, so ask for someone to show you around the public spaces and the spa facilities or you might not take advantage of all the hotel has to offer. If you are in Prague for more than a few hours be sure to ask the concierge for help with a self-guided walking tour, places to see and where to eat. The hotel offers an airport pick up and drop off services\, which you definitely want to use as it is efficient and inexpensive."

"243202","107679","1","The room I had was near the train tracks. Loud at night with the cargo trains running much of the night. Next time I would ask for the inner courtyard rooms by the pool or the side parking lot."
"243205","107680","1","Bring your swimsuit as the spa facilities require you wear one and build an hour into your schedule each day to throughly enjoy. You must have an appointment on the weekend, so if you arrive then I'd recommend you call or email the spa to arrange an hour of use."
"243208","107681","1","The floors were full of stains, even some bath towels. Dirty floor in the bath room. The trash was full from the guest before. "
"243211","107682","1","Make sure your bathroom door isn’t a glass door."
"243214","107683","1","Enjoy the central location in beautiful Binz."

"243227","107688","1","If you stay at the next-door at the Yurbban Passages Hotel (where you eat meals or use the spa, regardless) you won't have to shuttle back and forth for meals. Their rooftop pool and bar (visible from next door) were larger and open far more frequently."
"243230","107689","1","Highly recommended. "

- Ask the hotel to arrange your transfers from the airport / port.
- We thought the location was divine : 10 mins from Fira and 15 mins from Imerovigli, without being in the busyness of either of these towns. You can do the walk (1 hour) or take the bus to Oia to see the famous Oia sunset, but frankly we thought the view was just as amazing from this hotel. "

"243534","107815","1","The description of this hotel is completely misleading. It is by no means a boutique hotel. The room was large with a large bathroom and it was clean. Those were the only positives. It was decorated with extremely basic furniture. Carpet had stains. Pillow cases were too small for the pillows. There was a large gap between the mattress and the wall and the headboard did not come down to cover that. I had to stuff a pillow down the gap. Multiple other disappointments:
No minibar
No room service despite the description saying it was available 24/7. The hotel said you could pick up a “room service” order from the restaurant in the hotel but I called the room service number multiple times and no one answered. 
Lastly the air conditioning fan was extremely noisy. 
After driving all day, I needed a good meal and a good nights sleep. That was not possible. I checked out and drove over to Crossroads Hotel which is a true boutique hotel and had all the amenities and service missing from The Fontaine. "

"243567","107829","1","Un hotel “mid-century”, ma non nel senso del “high modernism and hedonistic glamour of the swinging Sixties and Seventies” che cita l’altisonante descrizione,  ma piuttosto perché sembra che non sia stato più toccato dagli anni 50 almeno (neanche da un addetto delle pulizie). 
La zona in cui si trova è sporca e mal frequentata, e l’hotel affaccia su una via molto trafficata (non la nostra camera che invece dava su un interno brutto e desolato).
La nostra camera, una junior suite, era al secondo piano, alla fine di un corridoio moquettato buio e maleodorante. 
La stanza odorava di fumo (nascosto da qualche profumo). 
Gli arredi, soprattutto in bagno, erano vecchi e non restaurati: i segni di ammaloramento erano un po’ ovunque, soprattutto sui pavimenti molto rovinati (o sporchi?), le laccature delle parti in legno erano saltate in molte parti , c’erano cavi elettrici scoperti che uscivano dal muro, buchi mal rappezzati nelle pareti, macchie sui ripiani in marmo, e una luce fiochissima, al neon. 

In generale tutta la stanza dava un senso di scarsa pulizia, con macchie sulle porte, polvere, e carta da parati rovinata in più punti. 

Quando abbiamo fatto presente la cosa, ci è stato proposto un cambio con altre due stanze sullo stesso piano, che però erano ugualmente vecchie, buie e mal curate. 

Sappiamo che l’hotel ha a disposizione altre stanze che invece sono state rinnovate (per esempio al quinto piano), ma a noi non è stata mai proposta la scelta (eventualmente anche con una differenza di prezzo) neanche in fase di prenotazione. 

Oltre a tutto questo, al momento di fare la colazione (compresa nella nostra tariffa), ci è stato detto che non era invece inclusa, e che avremmo dovuto pagarla. 
Dopo diverse discussioni e saliscendi tra sala della colazione e reception, ci hanno fatto la magnanima concessione di non farcela pagare “anche se in realtà non era compresa”.

The hotel runs a shuttle into town that drops you off at a related hotel property, which is much better than trying to drive yourself and look for parking. 
If you like a shower rather than a bath, as for a room with a shower or you might get a shower over a bath configuration that always makes me feel like I am going to do myself in. The shower-only configuration I got felt like a room itself!"

They used to have a free shuttle that now just sits out front and they charge for use when they decide it’s applicable.

Upon arrival I was greeted poorly.  I had requested that some documents be printed and they did not prepare anything.  Upon check-in, my room was not ready (which was fine as I arrived early) but they never called me to tell me it was ready even if they had my cell phone number.  The front desk people are actually quite rude and very unhelpful in all aspects.  It is also VERY noisy at night with partyers all around.

Lots of debris on the street, but to be expected downtown.  The bar I liked, and the drinks were good.  The food looked good but I didn't think the flavors were great.  I would say the food was not special and I had other meals around town I thought were far better.  There is no pool.  The reciprocity with the other hotel nearby that has a pool has ended, so if you want to swim, this is not the hotel for you. "

Funky cool vibe with quirky design/ ambiance surprises (quality of robes and sheets; freshly baked cookies and candies mid day with lime aid) BUT that’s not why you stay at a hotel. Worn out room w broken curtains, dark carpet, ripped screens, mediocre quality bed spread, a mattress that dipped in both sides and and and… They “forgot” to clean our room one day (even though we were out the full day) and lost our laundry (eventually found). Staff was open hearted and casual and did their best BUT …

"245383","108568","1","Fantastic “hub” site for seeing the many facets of Iceland’s largest national park. Too much to see and do for us so we hope to be back!"
"245388","108570","1","Some suites have great (and rather large) private balconies."
"245391","108571","1","Book it. An excellent choice"
"245396","108573","1","Some rooms on the busy main street may be too noisy, but our sea-view room that overlooked the main street was actually very quiet."
"245399","108574","1","The beds are awful."
"245402","108575","1","the hot tubs weren't working so check before you go."
"245405","108576","1","The rooms are very small. The bathrooms are cramped and for the price you would hope they were bigger. We used the pool and sauna which was the highlight of the hotel but the rooms leave much to be desired."
"245416","108581","1","What an amazing beautiful and special place"
"245419","108582","1","The drive to the property can be a little intimidating, especially at night. Road conditions aren't the best, so go slow and carefully!"
"245428","108586","1","Not really worth the expense. Maybe good for one person. "
"245431","108587","1","Allocate some time to relax in the house and to enjoy the grounds."
"245434","108588","1","Request a room facing the garden "
"245437","108589","1","The hotel's Michelin-starred restaurant, Bellefeuille, is an excellent idea for dinner"
"245442","108591","1","We hadn't realised this was a Marriott hotel but this was a bonus as we had a loyalty account with them too.  This is a big resort style hotel with good restaurants but outside of that there is no food/supermarkets/restaurants close - all need car to get to.  Great if you want to stay put and not think about anything."
"245445","108592","1","On a practical note the hotel was right by bus stop 6 which serves the airport and the bus to the Blue Lagoon - very handy."
"245448","108593","1","We were tired one evening and decided to order some snacks from the hotel instead of waiting for a table at any of the nearby restaurants. They were so good! Also- way larger than anticipated, so keep that in mind when ordering. "
"245451","108594","1","use the hotel car and visit some of the private rooms in the royal family’s residence."
"245460","108598","1","For light sleepers, avoid the room facing the road. Opposite side of the road are nightclubs. The sound can still penetrate the windows. "

"245468","108601","1","Book an Andes View Room"
"245477","108605","0","Work with Giacomo via email once you have reserved to discuss types of rooms available as they are each unique. You will find him very personable and attentive. The breakfast is plentiful and fresh. Nearby restaurants are all quite good for simple meals. And the neighborhood is lively with residents rather than tourists. You will appreciate the sanctity of your room after a day in the city navigating the crowds. "
"245480","108606","1","Line up parking ahead of time. 
Great location for all activities!
Breakfast is worth waking up for!"

"245504","108616","1","great location!"
"245516","108621","1","We absolutely loved the Bayou Bar with live music, rooftop bar and Jack Rose restaurant and lounge - connected to the hotel. Great service, drinks, food.  The hotel is in the beautiful Garden District and but not a convenient walk to the French Quarter."
"245519","108622","1","Restaurant Coral. Don't waste time to find any better restaurant. This is it."
"245522","108623","1","Take pictures at night. The structure and lighting are sublime"
"245525","108624","0","Just understand the difference between a 4 star hotel and a 5 star hotel in Europe!"
"245528","108625","1","Went for a deluxe room with a balcony, but the balcony was right over a busy road so we couldn't really sit there. Would recommend only going for a balcony if you can get a room higher in the building. "
"245537","108629","1","A lovely place to stay!"
"245540","108630","1","The steak with frites and Bernaise at the restaurant is a  must."
"245543","108631","0","It is a 20 minute walk to the pier, but the hotel will pick you up when you arrive- that was not clear in the description but was a lovely. "
"245546","108632","1","If you plan to sleep before the night club closes be certain to bring ear plugs (the hotel can also supply standard ear plugs)."

"245564","108639","0","This place is the best."
"245571","108642","1","Magical visit!!  The welcome from the proprietors/owners, the service, the best location in a Bruges with a terrace you could spend all day!   Close to everything but in quiet lovely St Ann’s across the canal— just perfect!"

And there is no room service for food"
"245585","108648","1","Stay out of the shopping of Palmiro and Cefalu.  Way to tourist.  Cefalu is pretty but same.  Just stay at the hotel and rest before the flight out."

"245610","108658","1","Great choice for couples, families and friends who are traveling for work, pleasure and weekend."
"245615","108660","1","Stairs could be an issue if you don’t like them, request low floor room. "
"245620","108662","1","."
"245627","108665","1","Ask for a room not above the bar or facing the street unless you like to feel the bass from the music in the bar through your bed. "

"245641","108670","1","You may need to take a taxi for many of the activities due to the location of the hotel which is not very central "
"245644","108671","1","The only thing to consider that this hotel has no restaurant, it has a delicious breakfast but for lunch and dinner you will need to find other alternatives  "
"245647","108672","1","Just to note that this hotel has no restaurant on site, you can still get a delicious breakfast but need other alternatives for lunch and dinner "
"245650","108673","1","Take a bigger room..."
"245653","108674","1","The restaurant is “high energy” - food is fine - but the noise and traffic levels mean it is not a place for a quiet night and conversation.  "
"245656","108675","1","We started out on the fourth floor which had a pretty great view but since we were there 6 days we asked if we could move up to an even higher floor. They were able to accommodate us and we moved from 401 to 601. Beautiful rooms both with the turkish bath on the patio. Highly recmmend these rooms!"
"245659","108676","1","Stay somewhere else - doesn't live up to the Viceroy name in anyway."
"245662","108677","1","Oui"
"245665","108678","1","Hotel razoável com boa localização. Quartos são mínimos"
"245672","108681","1","The location isn’t good for walking around at night. Seemed more like a glorified motel with a few styled items to make it look nicer. Did not not feel like the photos on tablet accuracy represented the hotel. Cold and creepily quiet atmosphere. Would not recommend."
"245675","108682","1","It was a delight to stay here. Would love to return one day."
"245678","108683","1","A little far from city center; but only about a 10 minute walk to the train station. "
"245681","108684","1","Look up additional photos online and don’t stay during off season. It’s a huge hotel and feels creepy when it’s so empty. "
"245690","108688","1","Opt for a room with window seats looking out over Siena red rooftops"
"245695","108690","1","Have dinner at the restaurant, have Sophia arrange wine tour for you - both were fantastic !"
"245698","108691","1","If you book in advance, maybe you'll find a good offer.
Be careful and control your reservation because in my case, they charged me for things that I already had paid!"
"245701","108692","1","When I booked this hotel I originally booked the Studio King based on the picture - which turned out to be of the Chelsea King. Lots more light and furnishing. I had several important business zooms to take, so I was excited for the setting to support that, but the first room I was in was dark and small with no table/surface…if your expectation is of a small, reasonable room with still-excellent furnishings, you’ll be fine with the Studio King. But make sure that’s all you’ll need if that’s the room you book. “Studio” is a bit of a misnomer, I think - if it were me I’d switch the names.

(The hotel pushed back on a full upgrade based on the discrepancy, but eventually gave me a Chelsea King with bath for the price of a Chelsea King. Tablet, for their part, were amazing to deal with and secured a few extra benefits to help ameliorate the experience, as it ultimately took me 6 hours to square, sitting in an undisturbed hotel room I didn’t plan to use after flying in on a redeye.)"
"245706","108694","1","absolutely give it a try!"
"245717","108699","1","Enjoy the fireplace in the common area and definitely don't skip breakfast!"
"245720","108700","1","Ask the team at the desk for where to eat. They steered us incredibly well for two dinners!  And if you have a car, book parking ahead as their space is limited. "
"245725","108702","1","I like to work at the hotels i stay at public spaces, this hotel didn’t had appealing public spaces that are suitable for work.

I wanted to go on a run, and the hotel recommendation was to drive to next towns because the roads surrounding the hotel are too busy to be safe."
"245728","108703","1","Spend more time at the hotel! I know you're in London and there is so much to see, but you should treat Number Sixteen like your home and get comfortable enjoying the space!"
"245733","108705","1","Stay here whenever you can."
"245738","108707","1","If you want the Michelin quality Tablet hotels wants to offer don’t go there "
"245741","108708","1","The rooftop pool was nice.  Small, and not much of a lively scene, but a nice relaxing spot on a sunny day.   "
"245750","108712","1","Savor the breakfast.  It’s a beautiful and delicious  spread.  

The pool area is also a little slice of heaven.  "

"245768","108718","1","Parkplatz außerhalb der Stadtmauer (kostenpflichtig). Personal kommt zum Parkplatz, transportiert Koffer zum Hotel und zeigt den Weg."
"245775","108721","1","Ravello is stunning, as is the hotel overall. But you in my opinion you are paying a pretty penny mostly for the views and the amenities. Not the room and the service. "
"245778","108722","1","Be a Tablet member for ultimate benefits and service"
"245785","108725","1","Il parcheggio non è dell'hotel "

"245809","108735","0","Do yourself a favor and opt for a quiet charming village over the more popular cities. The island is so small it's easy to travel to a visit Oia and the Fira and the beaches on the east side of the island.  We were always so happy to come home at the end of the day to the quiet peace of the Vedema hotel."
"245816","108738","1","Bring bath bombs and get a room with the tub. Know that you will be lured to stay at the property vs exploring London. Sleepy part of town on the weekends esp sunday."

"245824","108741","1","+
Rooms are large and quite nice
Food is good (like everywhere overthere).

This is not a 5 star’s level. It seems this 5 stars level is very low in italy.
The swimming pool is not heated so we could not use it for the whole stay."

"245849","108752","1","Be prepared lo slow down. Accept the easy atmosphere and you will never want to leave."
"245852","108753","1","Our room faced the fabulous market but our 4th floor room was quiet, so don’t be afraid of a street-facing room.  "

"245878","108763","1","1) spend the extra money and stay here. It’s so worth it. 

2) Request/ book a room that is across from the st pancras hotel. It is a gorgeous building to see outside your room. 

3) make time to dine at the restaurant upstairs one night. 

4) wake up early enough to have a proper English b’fast downstairs. "

"245931","108786","0","Book a slot at the indoor pool, it's worth it. For 15 euros you get access to the pool, steam room, and indoor and outdoor spa. We booked the last slot of the day and had the space to ourselves for most of the time. Also ask the reception desk for their list of restaurant recommendations (they have them printed out)  behind the desk. There are some great places on the list and otherwise it can be difficult to find places to go that are good and not touristy. "

"246222","108901","1","I stayed here years ago, and the experience then was much more magical than it is today. 

The hotel feels incredibly outdated and needs a lot of love to bring it up to what I would class as Tablet standards. The bathrooms used a fully water-resistant material that felt so cheap and synthetic and was quite literally falling off the walls in a few areas. The rest of the bedroom is tired and worn...sadly.

Overall – disappointed and won't be staying here again. I don't think it should be featured on Tablet any longer for the record."

Some showers are outside (ours was), which made for a interesting experience in sub-freezing weather. If you're cold easily and you're visiting in winter, bring warm clothing. Heaters are provided but are space heaters only. There's a chance your plumbing will freeze overnight as we were told by staff. Staff is not available from 11pm to 7am in case of plumbing emergencies. We were told to leave the sink dripping to prevent frozen pipes. Wifi only works in the main lodge (which you are nowhere near) and T-mobile/AT&amp;T has one bar reception when holding your phone against the window only.

I was entitled to an upgrade but did not receive one and the hotel was not fully booked. 
As soon as you entered the room there was a very overpowering smell incents which you then realised is to cover the smell of damp coming from the very tiny en-suite.
The bed is awful, the lumps in it, you would sleep much more comfortably on the floor.
The noise from the street is very loud as the room is on the corner of a very busy street of restaurants therefore the noise goes on very late.  I would not recommend this room it was not worth the incredible cost for what you received.  So very disappointed.
The only positive I will give is that Gerard is quite helpful."

"247179","109296","0","The spa is world class, so bring your bathing suit and set aside at least an hour to sample every type of steam room. The hotel overlooks a central park and is next to the Parliament. As result, any time there is a protest (often in Greece), it ties up traffic around the hotel, making it hard to get in or out on time. The Acropolis is half a mile away. Take a taxi there and walk back, but DO NOT MISS IT. You simply can't imagine the soaring feeling from the top of the hill, and not feel the ghostly presence of the world's greatest thinkers, warriors and artists. It's a truly moving experience. Also visit the new Museum of the Acropolis, just on the perimeter of the ancient site. It is a modern facility that brings you into close contact with the most sublime elements of antiquity."

"247431","109400","1","The rooms are smaller in size than I had expected, and as with many hotels they cram furniture and too-big-a-bed into the space. It was impossible to have our cases out all the time and walk around the room. We moved the marble circular table and chair aside to make room. "
"247434","109401","1","At least try and book the biggest room possible as your budget will stretch too. Makes for a wonderful experience"

"247440","109403","1","Great location for tourist attractions such as the Tower of London. I booked this hotel to be specifically in that part of London to be able to get to the river / Tower of London easily, and it was great for walking to this attraction from the hotel. "

"247468","109415","1","Super easy to take the S-bahn from MUC straight to Marienplatz and it's a half block. Ask for a deluxe room overlooking the market. Do book at dinner at the restaurant. There is a perfect Italian coffee shop 4 blocks away, Cafe Centrale. Go there every morning. It's like a trip to Roma or Milano. "
"247471","109416","1","Please do not stay here. I had to check out of the hotel because the sheet was so dirty that gave me rash and I could not sleep. "

"247483","109421","1","Ask about the thermostats in the room "
"247486","109422","1","Location is great! Layout of rooms, too. Keep in mind that rooms facing the street are extremely noisy (even with earplugs). Don’t bring a car if at all possible—parking is a challenge. Services are a bit limited, so if you go with that in mind you will likely be ok. Definitely not luxury, but still a decent spot. "

"247585","109462","1","We stayed 6 days in Singapore: 3 days downtown and 3 days in Villa Samadhi. That was great. It’s a bit too far to be used as the main place to stay for extended periods of time, but great for end of stay, when we spent more time staying at the hotel. 
There is a restaurant next to it that is beautiful and served great breakfasts. We went once for diner and found it very expensive for the food served. "

If you are interested in visiting the Lobby Bar, get there by 5 or 5:30 p.m. to be sure you get a table.  It was full by 5:30 on a January Saturday.  

Be aware that the lower floors are still under construction, so there may be some banging and construction noise during work hours.  However, the prices are quite reasonable right now, and that is probably because of the construction. Once construction is completed, I imagine that the prices will increase substantially. Our stay was from Friday through Monday, and we were not bothered by the construction."
"247686","109503","1","Rooms looking out from the face of the building on Tordenskjoldsgade have the best light and aspect. I would suggest go for those. Avoid the entry level rooms as these are not such good value - very small with a compromised aspect."

"247788","109543","1","Magical and surreal atmosphere and view. Beautiful resort!"
"247791","109544","1","Contact the hotel for your airport transfer. The prices are extremely reasonable, and the staff will meet you on the street and escort you to the hotel. (It would be difficult to find the hotel by yourself without the escort, as it is about a 5 minute walk through the Medina from the area where the cars park)."
"247794","109545","1","Don't miss out on this relaxed South Ken jem.  It's staff and ambiance are a real winning combo."
"247797","109546","1","Living in a big city U.S. city, I have a probable unhealthy obsession with safety and security. The rooms at Riad Camilia have no locks on them (which I suspect is the case at all or most riads) which made me a little uneasy. The hotel manager quickly put my mind at ease by providing a lock and key. If you have the same concern, be advised and comforted that a solution is readily available. BTW - Riad Camilia felt super safe and no one can just walk-into the property -- so locks for most won't be a concern.

A second tip would be to book your airport transfers via Riad Camilia. The price is reasonable and the drivers know exactly where to go. On arrival, they coordinate with hotel staff for an escort/baggage handling to the front door of the Riad. Note - many riads, including Riad Camilia, are located on tiny streets/alleyways that are not accessible by vehicles. A car/van can only get you so far and the rest is a short walk. Booking a roundtrip airport transfer directly with Riad Camilia will ensure a smooth and worry-free arrival and departure."

"247803","109548","1","Noisy hotel depending where your room is situated. There is a nightclub next door. The rooms do not match the level design the hotel spent on its lobby and restaurant, which may sound superficial, but it is somewhat misleading based on the pictures provided. "
"247806","109549","1","Great hotel with well equipped and spacious rooms (for London). And we really enjoyed the complimentary hot chocolate each evening in our room. Nice hotel gesture. "

"247814","109552","1","I only saw a suite which I gather feels smaller than the regular rooms but I loved the suite as it felt very cozy and like your own little apartment. I just think it would be challenging if you had more than one suitcase!"

"247871","109576","1","If you decide to stay in the main house in one of the larger King rooms do note that this a a third floor walk up. The steps are grand and easy as stairs go but it would be difficult if you had mobility impairments. Food and dining options over the Christmas holiday were a bit limited and there were several private gatherings in main public spaces of the hotel during our three dat stay. Wasn't a problem for us, but seemed important to note. Reservations for dining are recommended prior to arrival. Staff went out of their way to accommodate us."
"247876","109578","1","It is very charming for a good price. The location is a bit undesirable and depressing during lousy weather. The plants around the front door help, but the sad homeless do not."
"247879","109579","1","Use the Tram steps away to get to all the central locations in the city and SMN Stazione Centrale. Runs every a few minutes. Very easy. Avoid rush hours though as it can get packed. "

"247890","109583","1","Overall the hotel is gorgeous and in a perfect location. Its is a little on the darker side aesthetically (think sultry, romantic) so if you are the kind of person that needs a lot of sunshine/bright colors in the winter, that may be worth mentioning but otherwise the hotel is just so incredible.

Check in during the day. the day staff is most welcoming. "
"247920","109595","1","Don’t rely on the hotel staff to help with anything. They’ll send a nice text saying “what can we do” and then when you make any request or ask - they can’t help with anything. Literally. Nothing. "
"247923","109596","1","Have a cocktail at Anonymous Bar - very cool! "
"247926","109597","1","If you can find a low rate here and aren't looking for creature comforts in the room, the public spaces provide a nice, kitschy vibe and you're within easy reach of a lot of Waikiki. But it very clearly operates at a more basic level than most (if not all) Honolulu hotels you will find on Tablet."

"247991","109625","1","If you’re in San Luis Obispo stay at The San Luis Obispo Hotel."
"247994","109626","1","Rooms are small, website pictures do not represent all the rooms in category. "
"248009","109633","1","A great place to stay for first time visitors to CDMX - the neighborhood was very walkable and felt safe. Be sure to check out Parque Mexico a few blocks away to watch the area dogs being trained! There may be a nightclub or venue nearby because loud music was blaring until 4am one of the nights, and there's going to be construction noises as the neighborhood is expanding, but overall a great place to spend a long weekend!"
"248012","109634","1"," The rooms are very small with not much space to move around or store your clothing. I do love the charm and boutique feel and will gladly give up this for what this place offers. We were 5 minutes from Moulin Rouge and Times Square. The bed and linens were so nice. Very clean and wonderful!! "
"248015","109635","1","Make sure to check out the rooftop bar. "
"248018","109636","1","I would look elsewhere. "

"248079","109662","1","the breakfast is so good!"
"248090","109667","1","Don’t be put off by the nightclub vibe! The rooms are well laid out and the best shower stall in London! "
"248095","109669","1","You get a good bed in a nice location. It's fine if you are looking for value "
"248100","109671","1","Only downside to this hotel is the lack of a restaurant, bar, etc. However, it is just a couple blocks from a thriving downtown. And honestly, not having an onsite restaurant and bar encouraged me to leave the hotel and explore this great town, which was the right thing to do!"
"248111","109676","1","Amazing restaurants all around "
"248114","109677","1","All the rooms are quiet. My street facing room was silent. I think the courtyard facing rooms are longer and have light from both exposures.   The first floor rooms step out to a nice courtyard with fireplaces and seating. "

"248136","109686","1","Rooms are cozy. Not a lot of room for big suitcases as there is a fair amount of furniture. Shower was fantastic - great water pressure and water was truly warm.  If you like your room cool just have to ask the front desk to turn down the automatic thermostat as windows don't open. "
"248139","109687","1","Self park - it’s right past the valet and the garage elevator takes you right up to the hotel lobby and hotel floors; very reasonable price"

"248189","109706","1","Just a wonderful place in a subdued setting."
"248194","109708","1","Hotel has great bones. Beautiful pink building overlooking the Pacific Ocean in a beautiful part of La Jolla. As soon as you walk in though you notice the old tiles at the check in. Then the extremely old and slow elevator. My upgraded room which they called a junior suite with ocean views, was basically a standard room with a couch splitting up the room. The view was a side glimpse of the ocean with no privacy from the rest of the hotel or street if you opened the very tedious blinds (4x2 manual with very old metal pull strings circa 1980s).

Not one staff member including the two valet guys at the entrance ever smiled or made a friendly gesture the entire time. Breakfast was not included but didn’t look
Great so we found some nice local places which we enjoyed.

Bathroom was small with a bath/shower in one with dirty old European style shower curtain and zero water pressure. The bath was suitable for a 4foot6 person, assuming they hadn’t seen a more modern design than what they’d come to know and love in 1975. 1975 coincidentally seemed to be the last time the bath was cleaned.

I will not be going back here and I suggest tablet hotels which I booked through have a strong word with management."

"248218","109717","1","The elevator is a little slow. Getting downstairs via just staircases is not easy."
"248221","109718","1","Don't miss out on dining in the restaurant. Incredible food and impeccable service. "
"248228","109721","1","No ramp access at main entry for wheelchairs or baby carriages. Rooms somewhat dark. Cool vibe. "
"248233","109723","1","1. Right by the entrance of the property there’s a fresh market and wine shop - I HIGHLY recommend you stop there for wine, snacks and even meals! 
2. The hotel has great relationships with chartered boat vendors - I’d highly recommend this! The front reception can assist in arranging.
3. If you have a rainy day, be lazy and make the best in your room or at the spa. Keep the patio door open for that rain sound and you’re set to go. 
4. Try the shrimp salad at the beach club! "
"248238","109725","1","Small hotel, only 6 rooms. If you need multiple rooms, book early. "

"248251","109730","1","If you can get a good price and are looking for a buzzy place, stay here. Otherwise find something of a better quality. For this price it shouldn't be hard."
"248258","109733","1","The hotel is okay, but not great. If I was doing it over again I would book elsewhere."
"248263","109735","1","The hotel layout is a bit weird -- ALL of the rooms, and the fancier restaurant, are on one floor (the third), and laid out in a square.  So you can end up walking 1/2 a block+ to get to your room if it is on the back (as ours was).  Not a problem, just an FYI."
"248270","109738","1","Hotel is very close to all the bars and restaurants on the river , the bars are great but the restaurants are not so good "
"248273","109739","1","Worth springing for the deluxe rooms. The bad reviews you read are usually from the windowless rooms. Not a ton more space, but they feel better and have nice views.  "
"248276","109740","1","Hotel was lovely and room was as expected but be clear that it is very hands off. No lobby, no onsite services. The restaurant operates on weekends only and no services available otherwise. "
"248283","109743","1","Pick a different hotel."
"248288","109745","1","Do not stay here. A Motel 6 these days would be a tremendous upgrade."

"248301","109750","1","Arrange for  private tours or just a driver through the hotel. It costs minimally more and it’s an experience more tailored to your needs. We shorten an 4 hour graffiti tour to 1.5 hours and a 10 hour Guatapé/ El Pentol from 10 hours to 5. Valuable time is not wasted where you can just chill at the beautiful amenities at the hotel."
"248304","109751","1","The full breakfast was terrific and free for Tablet bookings. In fact, the staff told me I was entitled to free breakfast, I didn’t even realize it, very good service."
"248313","109755","1","There was a decent amount of construction in the area so the view from the room was not the best. Some taxi drivers had a hard time figuring out where the hotel is. "
"248316","109756","1","This is a good option for a longer stay in Tokyo. As described by Tablet, despite the price  it is not a full luxury hotel so if you are looking for that  you should try elsewhere."

"248721","109922","1","Pay close attention to the room you book since upgrades might not happen. This is a nice option if you're looking for a good pool and planning on spending a lot of time not on hotel property, but I wouldn't book it if I were looking for true luxury. "

"249123","110085","1","Don’t bother with the spa. Prices are outrageous and it was the worst service I’ve ever received and I go to spas often. Waste of my money and time "
"249130","110088","1","This is a very efficient and comfortable hotel. The rooms are very small for the price (I stayed a few blocks away on the same trip and paid the same for a room twice the size with a balcony). But it feels like a luxury hotel in its design and it's clearly a locals' hangout for brunch and drinks. There are lots of great restaurants nearby and I definitely made use of the food hall."
"249135","110090","1","Note that the hotel is remote. In my opinion it is not close enough to trek your equipment to the lifts so you would need a taxi. The rooms are clean but pretty basic. Bathrooms are poorly lit. "
"249138","110091","1","Hotel is in a tight location —- everything seems a little squeezed in. If you exit the hotel on the backside you enter a somewhat sketchy road, esp at night "

"249189","110112","1","Make sure you have full info how to enter building from street after hours or at night. NR is in an old palazzo with several floors which you enter through a courtyard behind the outer door. It’s also used for parking etc., so is not pristine, but once you get upstairs (old fashioned lift), the place is very nice. "

"249223","110125","1","Getting there can be a bit confusing because GPS takes you to a dead end road and signs are not too visible. 

If you’re planning on eating at the restaurant, make sure you have enough time since service is a bit slow. 

Always double check your receipt, I was overcharged. "

"249317","110164","1","We arrived at the hotel at about 6pm, having driven in from Los Angeles - about a 6 hour drive. Upon checking in at the front desk we were informed that our room was not ready, even though check-in time was posted as 4pm. I asked how long it would be and was told “possibly 30 minutes or so - the previous guests had a late check-out”. So we were not off to a great start. Road weary and looking forward to changing and washing up, we were offered “drinks on the hotel at the bar” - which was of no interest to us at that moment. I asked the front desk employee if she could please find us a room that is ready as we were exhausted from the drive and that we were not thrilled having to wait. We were told that “the hotel is pretty full right now and we don’t have another room to offer you”. I then asked what time check-out time normally is and I was told 11am. I asked if we could please have a late check-out tomorrow, 12 noon would work for us. And the same employee who had just explained to me that our room was not ready due to the previous guests checking out late, said “I'll have to see if a late check out is possible”. Again, not the answer I was expecting in this situation where we were already being inconvenienced by the hotel. After approximately 25 minutes we were told that our room was ready. Later that night we met friends downstairs in the hotel bar. There was only one table that would fit the four of us and the folks that had been eating and drinking there had paid their bill and left, but the table had not yet been cleared. My wife asked the wait staff if someone could please bus the table so we could sit down - she was told by the employee, “It’ll take a few minutes”. Not really the way you expect to be spoken to as a guest at the Ritz-Carlton. A simple “yes, we will take care of that for you” would have been more appropriate. After 8 or 9 minutes the table was cleared and cleaned. My feeling is that the employees at this Ritz Carlton need to go through the Fou"
